**What Model are you using?**

gpt-4o-mini

**Describe the bug**

Follow up on https://github.com/567-labs/instructor/issues/661 since that was closed before it was fixed

When streaming with a `|`, it crashes with `TypeError: type 'types.UnionType' is not subscriptable`

**To Reproduce**

```python
import instructor
from pydantic import BaseModel
from openai import OpenAI


class User(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int
    category: str | None

client = instructor.from_openai(OpenAI())

# Extract structured data from natural language
res = client.chat.completions.create_partial(
    model=""gpt-4o-mini"",
    response_model=User,
    messages=[{""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""John Doe is 30 years old.""}],
)
res
```


**Expected behavior**

Swapping to Union works, but I expect them both to work

```python
import instructor
from pydantic import BaseModel
from openai import OpenAI


class User(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int
    category: Union[str, None]

client = instructor.from_openai(OpenAI())

It would be helpful if you could provide the API key as part of the from_provider constructor, as settings are often managed outside the environment variables. Currently the only option is to pass it to the client, but that removes the LLM provider-agnostic solution of from_provider()

**Describe the solution you'd like**
This code should be accepted
```
    instructor_client = instructor.from_provider(
        model=settings.LLM_MODEL,
        api_key=settings.LLM_API_KEY
    )
```

Today this results in an Exception:
`The api_key client option must be set either by passing api_key to the client or by setting the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable`

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
- Environment variables: Not easy to change at runtime etc.
- Setting the API key directly on the client: Impossible to write LLM provider-agnostic code

I don't want the schema of my BaseModel objects to be printed to the screen when my LLM is invoked. I am using Gemini LLM products with this code:

```
 instructor_client = instructor.from_gemini(
            client=native_gemini_model,
            mode=instructor.Mode.GEMINI_TOOLS,
        )

structured_output_instance = instructor_client.create(
                response_model=response_model_cls,

                max_retries=max_retries,
            )
```

And each time the schema of `response_model_cls` is printed due to line `response_model.gemini_schema` in `handle_gemini_tools` in `instructor.process_response`. 

**Describe the solution you'd like**
If possible, I could add a `verbose` arg when creating the instructor client. Something like:

```
        instructor_client = instructor.from_gemini(
            client=native_gemini_model,
            mode=instructor.Mode.GEMINI_TOOLS,
            verbose=False,  <-- added!
        )
```
This would prevent the schema from printing to the screen.

2978174422,101,Establish Comprehensive Core Test Setup & Mocking Strategy (`agentdock-core`),oguzserdar,850772,closed,2025-04-07T22:58:59Z,2025-05-02T04:00:24Z,https://github.com/AgentDock/AgentDock,https://github.com/AgentDock/AgentDock/issues/101,"## Problem Description

While `agentdock-core` uses Jest, the current testing setup lacks a rigorously defined and enforced strategy for **comprehensive unit testing**. Existing tests, if present, may not sufficiently isolate units or cover all critical logic paths. A clear strategy for dependency mocking and isolated unit testing is needed to ensure reliability and maintainability as the core evolves.

## Proposed Solution

1.  **Define & Document Mocking Strategy:**
    *   Establish clear, documented guidelines within `agentdock-core` (e.g., in `TESTING.md` or `CONTRIBUTING.md`) on the mandatory use of `jest.fn()`, `jest.mock()`, `jest.spyOn`, etc., to **strictly isolate** the unit under test from its dependencies.
    *   Mandate that all direct dependencies (other core classes, external clients, utilities) MUST be mocked in unit tests.
2.  **Review & Refactor Existing Tests:**
    *   Audit any existing unit tests to ensure they adhere to the strict isolation and mocking strategy.
    *   Refactor tests that are not true unit tests (i.e., rely on real dependencies) to use mocks.
3.  **Setup Helper Functions (Optional but Recommended):**
    *   Create reusable test setup helper functions (e.g., in `agentdock-core/src/__tests__/helpers/`) to standardize and simplify the creation of mocked dependencies (e.g., `createMockStorageProvider()`, `createMockOrchestrationManager()`).
4.  **Configure Jest:** Ensure Jest configuration within `agentdock-core` (`jest.config.js` or `package.json`) is optimized for unit testing (e.g., specifying `testEnvironment`, `clearMocks: true`, coverage thresholds).

## Acceptance Criteria

*   Clear, documented guidelines exist and are enforced for mocking dependencies in `agentdock-core` unit tests.
*   Key existing unit tests are refactored to meet the strict isolation standard.
*   (Optional) Reusable test setup helpers are implemented and used.
*   Jest configuration is verified and optimized for comprehensive unit testing.

**Dependencies:** None - Foundational task for subsequent testing issues."

The orchestration module (`OrchestrationManager`, `OrchestrationStateManager`, `StepSequencer`) forms the brain of agent behavior, managing state transitions, tool sequences, and context. Existing tests, if any, are insufficient to guarantee the correctness and robustness of this critical, interconnected logic across all scenarios, conditions (like `tool_used` and `sequence_match`), and edge cases. Comprehensive unit testing with strict isolation is required.

## Proposed Solution

Implement thorough unit test suites for all core orchestration components (`OrchestrationManager`, `OrchestrationStateManager`, `StepSequencer`), ensuring **complete coverage** of their logic, interactions, and edge cases, using rigorously mocked dependencies as defined in the core testing strategy (https://github.com/AgentDock/AgentDock/issues/101).

**Required Test Coverage Areas:**

**1. `OrchestrationManager` (`index.ts`):**
    *   **`getActiveStep`:** Exhaustively test all activation paths (no steps, default only, `tool_used` conditions, `sequence_match` conditions, mixed conditions, multiple matches, default fallback), state updates on transition, and error handling.
    *   **`getAllowedTools`:** Test all filtering scenarios (no active step, `allowed` only, `denied` only, both, interaction with mocked `StepSequencer`).
    *   **`processToolUsage`:** Verify calls to mocked `Sequencer`, verify the crucial re-evaluation call to `getActiveStep` *after* tool processing.
    *   **Other Methods:** Verify correct delegation to mocked `OrchestrationStateManager` (`getState`, `updateState`, `resetState`, `removeSession`).

**2. `OrchestrationStateManager` (`state.ts`):**
    *   **Initialization:** Test constructor logic and dependency setup.
    *   **State Lifecycle:** Exhaustively test `getOrCreateState`, `getState`, `updateState` (including partial updates), `resetState`, `addUsedTool` (array logic), `setActiveStep`.
    *   **State Conversion (`toAIOrchestrationState`):** Verify correct mapping.
    *   **Cleanup (`cleanupSession`):** Verify delegation.
    *   **Interaction:** Verify correct calls to mocked `SessionManager` and `StorageProvider`.
    *   **Error Handling:** Test behavior when mocked dependencies throw errors.

**3. `StepSequencer` (`sequencer.ts`):**
    *   **`hasActiveSequence`:** Test all scenarios (no/empty sequence, index in/out of bounds, initialization).
    *   **`getCurrentSequenceTool`:** Test all scenarios (no/inactive sequence, correct tool retrieval, sequence complete).
    *   **`advanceSequence`:** Test successful advancement and state update call; test no-sequence behavior.
    *   **`processTool`:** Test state update call (`addUsedTool`), no-sequence behavior, correct advancement on match, no advancement on mismatch.
    *   **`filterToolsBySequence`:** Test all scenarios (no/inactive/complete sequence, correct filtering when tool available/unavailable).

**Dependencies:** Requires a well-defined core mocking strategy (https://github.com/AgentDock/AgentDock/issues/101). Mocking of `SessionManager`, `StorageProvider`, and inter-orchestration components is essential.

## Acceptance Criteria

*   Achieve high unit test coverage (lines, branches, functions) for `OrchestrationManager`, `OrchestrationStateManager`, and `StepSequencer`, verified by coverage reports.
*   All specified logic paths, conditions, state transitions, and interactions within the orchestration module are explicitly tested.
*   Tests strictly adhere to the isolation and mocking strategy, ensuring true unit testing."

The storage module provides the foundation for state persistence via the `StorageProvider` abstraction and its concrete implementations (Memory, Redis, Vercel KV, future SQLite), plus the `StorageFactory` for instantiation. Existing tests, if any, are insufficient to guarantee that each provider correctly implements the interface contract (including TTL) and that the factory behaves as expected. Comprehensive unit testing is needed for data integrity and reliability.

## Proposed Solution

Implement thorough unit test suites for **all** components within the storage module, ensuring **complete coverage** of the `StorageProvider` interface contract for each implementation, the logic within the `StorageFactory`, and any validation within storage types, using mocked dependencies where appropriate.

**Required Test Coverage Areas:**

**1. Each `StorageProvider` Implementation (`providers/`):**
    *   **Interface Compliance:** Verify implementation of *all* `StorageProvider` methods (`get`, `set`, `delete`, `clear`, `keys`, `has`, etc.).
    *   **CRUD Operations:** Exhaustively test `get`, `set` (create/update), `delete`, `has`, `keys`, `clear`. Include tests for non-existent keys and empty states.
    *   **TTL Functionality:**
        *   Test `set` with `ttlMs`.
        *   Verify `get` returns value *before* expiry.
        *   Verify `get` returns `null`/`undefined` *after* expiry (using Jest fake timers or appropriate techniques).
        *   Test `set` without `ttlMs` results in expected persistence.
    *   **Provider-Specific Logic:**
        *   Test correct interaction with mocked underlying clients/mechanisms (internal Map, Redis client commands, KV client methods, SQLite statements). Verify correct arguments, commands, and options.
        *   Test error handling when mocked clients throw errors.

**2. `StorageFactory` (`factory.ts`):**
    *   Test `getProvider` method:
        *   Verify correct provider instantiation based on `StorageConfig.type` (`memory`, `redis`, `vercel-kv`, future `sqlite`).
        *   Verify correct configuration options (namespace, TTL, Redis URL/token, etc.) are passed to provider constructors.
        *   Test handling of invalid or missing configuration options (e.g., fallback to memory, error logging).
    *   Test singleton behavior (if applicable, e.g., `getFactoryInstance`).

**3. Storage Types (`types.ts`):**
    *   Test any helper functions or validation logic defined within the types file itself (if present).

**Dependencies:** Requires a well-defined core mocking strategy (https://github.com/AgentDock/AgentDock/issues/101). Requires mocking underlying storage clients (Redis, Vercel KV, SQLite driver).

## Acceptance Criteria

*   Achieve high unit test coverage for each storage provider implementation, the storage factory, and relevant type definitions/validations.
*   All `StorageProvider` implementations are verified to comply with the interface contract, including CRUD and TTL logic.
*   The `StorageFactory` is verified to instantiate the correct providers with correct configurations based on input.

2978196865,104,Implement Comprehensive Unit Tests for Core Node System (`agentdock-core`),oguzserdar,850772,closed,2025-04-07T23:17:07Z,2025-05-05T02:39:24Z,https://github.com/AgentDock/AgentDock,https://github.com/AgentDock/AgentDock/issues/104,"## Problem Description

The core node system, including the `BaseNode` abstract class, `NodeRegistry`, and `ToolRegistry`, provides the fundamental structure for defining, discovering, and managing all functional units within AgentDock. Ensuring the correctness and robustness of this infrastructure through comprehensive unit testing is critical, as existing tests (if any) are likely insufficient.

## Proposed Solution

Implement thorough unit test suites for the core node system components, focusing on the registries and the validation of the `BaseNode` structure through its implementations. Mocks should be used where appropriate according to the core testing strategy  #101 .

**Required Test Coverage Areas:**

**1. `NodeRegistry` (`node-registry.ts`):**
    *   **Registration:** Test `registerNodeType` with valid and potentially duplicate types.
    *   **Retrieval:** Test `getNodeType` (found/not found), `getAllNodeTypes`.
    *   **Instantiation:** Test `createNodeInstance` for registered types (successful creation with correct config), test failure for unregistered types.
    *   **Singleton/Static Methods:** Test any static methods or singleton patterns used.

**2. ToolRegistry (tool-registry.ts):**
    *   **Registration:** Test `registerTool` with valid and potentially duplicate tool names.
    *   **Retrieval/Filtering via `getToolsForAgent`:**
        *   Test that `getToolsForAgent` correctly retrieves tools based on an exact list of tool names provided as input.
        *   Verify it returns an empty object when requested names don't exist or the input array is empty.
        *   *(Note: The current implementation does not include methods like `getTool` or `getAllTools`, nor does `getToolsForAgent` support filtering based on registry metadata beyond the provided tool names. Tests reflect the current, implemented behavior only.)*

**3. `BaseNode` Structure & Metadata (`base-node.ts` & Concrete Implementations):**
    *   While `BaseNode` is abstract, test its contract *via its concrete implementations* (like `AgentNode` - covered in a separate issue - or potentially a simple dedicated test node implementation).
    *   **Metadata Methods:** Verify that calls to `getMetadata`, `getInputPorts`, `getOutputPorts`, `getInputPort`, `getOutputPort` on a concrete node return correctly structured data based on that node's implementation of the abstract `get*` methods (`getCategory`, `getLabel`, `getInputs`, etc.).
    *   **Port Validation:** Ensure the `NodePort` structure (id, type, label, required, etc.) is correctly populated and retrieved.

**4. Index / Registration (`index.ts`, `register-core-nodes.ts`):**
    *   Verify that core nodes are correctly registered upon initialization (e.g., test that `registerCoreNodes` results in expected types being present in the `NodeRegistry`).

**Dependencies:** Requires a well-defined core mocking strategy (#101 ). Testing `BaseNode`'s contract relies on testing concrete node implementations.

## Acceptance Criteria

*   Achieve high unit test coverage for `NodeRegistry` and `ToolRegistry`.
*   Tests verify all registry operations (registration, retrieval, filtering, instantiation).
*   Tests verify that concrete node implementations correctly fulfill the `BaseNode` contract regarding metadata and port definitions.
*   Core node registration logic is tested.
*   Tests strictly adhere to the isolation and mocking strategy."

3065109931,169,Add Prettier for Consistent Code Formatting,cun3yt,24409240,closed,2025-05-15T06:29:10Z,2025-06-08T00:19:45Z,https://github.com/AgentDock/AgentDock,https://github.com/AgentDock/AgentDock/issues/169,"## Description
The codebase currently relies solely on ESLint for code style enforcement, but lacks a dedicated code formatter. While ESLint can enforce some style rules, a dedicated formatter would ensure consistent code style across the entire project.

## Current Status
- ESLint is configured and running via pre-push hooks
- Architecture docs mention ""ESLint & Prettier"" but Prettier isn't actually implemented
- No formatting scripts exist in package.json
- Code style may be inconsistent across the codebase

## Proposed Solution

1. Install Prettier and ESLint Prettier integration:
```
pnpm add -D prettier eslint-config-prettier
```

2. Create a basic `.prettierrc.js` config:
```js
module.exports = {
  semi: true,
  trailingComma: 'all',
  singleQuote: true,
  printWidth: 100,
  tabWidth: 2,
}
```

3. Update ESLint config to work with Prettier:
```js
// In eslint.config.js
import prettierConfig from 'eslint-config-prettier';
// Then add to the export array:
prettierConfig,
```

4. Add format scripts to package.json:
```json
""format"": ""prettier --write \""**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx,json,md}\"""",
""format:check"": ""prettier --check \""**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx,json,md}\"""",
```

5. Update the git-hooks validation script to include formatting checks

## Benefits
- Consistent code style across the codebase
- Reduced code review friction
- Alignment with documented architecture
- Better developer experience "

`agentops.init(**kwargs)` needs to correctly pass `**kwargs` downstream all the way to the Session and its relative components, including the `SessionTracer`.



For example, test that the following scenarios are tested thoroughly



---


```
agentops.init(
  exporter=AnyOtelExporter()
)
```



```
agentops.init(
  exporter=AnyOtelExporter()
)
```


---


Also ensure that the same config passed to `agentops.init()` eventually reflects in all `Session.config` created either through:

- bare `Session()` init
- `agentops.start_session()`



---

The initiative for opening this issue was that we have verified `agentops.init(exporter_endpoint=)` does not seem to correctly configure the exporter (actually, we configured env var `AGENTOPS_EXPORTER_ENDPOINT` which Config is ought to fallback to env var's value if the parameter isn't value at initialization

2917995962,825,Session link not appearing in terminal when AGENTOPS_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG,devin-ai-integration[bot],158243242,closed,2025-03-13T17:51:32Z,2025-03-14T03:39:00Z,https://github.com/AgentOps-AI/agentops,https://github.com/AgentOps-AI/agentops/issues/825,"## Issue Description

When setting AGENTOPS_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG, the AgentOps session link is not displayed in the terminal output.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Set environment variable: 
2. Import and initialize AgentOps: 
3. Make LLM calls (e.g., with OpenAI)

## Expected Behavior

The session link should be displayed in the terminal output regardless of the log level setting.

## Actual Behavior

The session link is not displayed when DEBUG log level is set.

## Additional Context

This issue was observed when using AgentOps with OpenAI in a Jupyter notebook environment. The session is being created correctly and events are being tracked, but the link to view the session in the dashboard is not displayed in the terminal output.

## Possible Solution

Ensure that the session link logging is not filtered out when DEBUG log level is set.

2918000414,827,Fix end_session() function missing token parameter,devin-ai-integration[bot],158243242,closed,2025-03-13T17:53:43Z,2025-03-14T04:05:42Z,https://github.com/AgentOps-AI/agentops,https://github.com/AgentOps-AI/agentops/issues/827,"## Issue Description

When using `agentops.end_session()`, the function requires a token parameter that isn't documented in the client implementation.

## Steps to Reproduce
```python
import agentops
agentops.init()
# ... code that uses agentops ...
agentops.end_session('Success')  # This fails with TypeError
```

## Error Message
```
TypeError: end_session() missing 1 required positional argument: 'token'
```

## Root Cause
The `end_session()` function in `agentops/__init__.py` requires both a span and token parameter, but the client implementation in `client.py` only requires an end_state parameter.

The issue is that `__init__.py` is calling the legacy version of `end_session()` which requires both parameters, while the client implementation has been updated.

## Proposed Solution
Update the `end_session()` function in `__init__.py` to match the client implementation, removing the token parameter requirement.

3147153169,1076,Missing @record_function decorator and AutoGen instrumentation reliability issues in v0.4.14,devin-ai-integration[bot],158243242,open,2025-06-15T06:12:41Z,,https://github.com/AgentOps-AI/agentops,https://github.com/AgentOps-AI/agentops/issues/1076,"# Missing @record_function decorator and AutoGen instrumentation reliability issues in v0.4.14

## Problem Description

We've identified two critical issues affecting users upgrading to AgentOps v0.4.14:

1. **Missing `@record_function` decorator**: The `@record_function` decorator that was available in previous versions is completely missing from v0.4.14, breaking existing user code that relies on manual instrumentation.

2. **AutoGen instrumentation reliability**: AutoGen support isn't working as expected due to incorrect version requirements and package naming confusion in the instrumentation configuration.

## Issue 1: Missing @record_function decorator

### Expected Behavior
Users should be able to use the `@record_function` decorator to manually instrument functions, as was available in previous versions.

### Current Behavior
The `@record_function` decorator is completely missing from the codebase. Attempting to import it results in:
```python
ImportError: cannot import name 'record_function' from 'agentops'
```

### Impact
- Breaks existing user code that relies on manual instrumentation
- No migration path or backward compatibility provided
- No documentation on what replaced this functionality

## Issue 2: AutoGen instrumentation reliability

### Expected Behavior
AutoGen instrumentation should work reliably with current AutoGen package versions and automatically track agent interactions.

### Current Behavior
- Minimum version requirement is set to ""0.1.0"" which is too low for real AutoGen packages
- Package naming confusion between ""autogen"", ""ag2"", and ""autogen_agentchat"" packages
- Import errors in examples indicate version compatibility issues
- Instrumentation may not activate due to incorrect version checks

### Evidence
1. **Incorrect version requirement**: 
   ```python
   # In agentops/instrumentation/__init__.py
   ""autogen"": {""module_name"": ""agentops.instrumentation.ag2"", ""class_name"": ""AG2Instrumentor"", ""min_version"": ""0.1.0""}
   ```
   The minimum version ""0.1.0"" is too low - AutoGen packages typically start from 0.3.x

2. **Import errors in examples**:
   ```python
   # In examples/ag2/agentchat_with_memory.py
   from autogen import ConversableAgent  # This import fails
   ```

3. **Package ecosystem confusion**: The instrumentation targets ""autogen"" package but the ecosystem has evolved to include ""ag2"" and ""autogen_agentchat"" packages

## Root Cause Analysis

### @record_function Issue
- The decorator was removed during the v4.x migration without providing backward compatibility
- The functionality was replaced by the `@tool` decorator but no migration guide was provided
- No deprecation warning was added to help users transition

### AutoGen Issue
- The AutoGen ecosystem has evolved with multiple package variants (autogen, ag2, autogen_agentchat)
- Version requirements haven't been updated to reflect real package versions
- Examples use inconsistent import patterns indicating version compatibility problems

## Proposed Solution

### 1. Restore @record_function with backward compatibility
- Add `@record_function` decorator to the legacy module with deprecation warning
- Make it wrap the new `@tool` decorator for functionality
- Export it in the main `__init__.py` for backward compatibility

### 2. Fix AutoGen instrumentation
- Update minimum version requirements to realistic values (0.3.2 for autogen)
- Add support for multiple AutoGen package variants (autogen, ag2)
- Fix import issues in examples

## User Impact
- **High**: Existing code using `@record_function` is completely broken
- **Medium**: AutoGen users may experience unreliable instrumentation
- **Migration**: Users need clear guidance on transitioning from `@record_function` to `@tool`

## Testing Strategy
- Verify `@record_function` works with deprecation warning
- Test AutoGen instrumentation with corrected version requirements
- Run AutoGen examples to ensure they work correctly
- Verify session tracking generates proper AgentOps links

This issue affects users who rely on manual instrumentation and AutoGen integration, making it a blocking issue for upgrading to v0.4.14.

3161130988,1095,feat: reduce verbose debug logging across all instrumentation modules,devin-ai-integration[bot],158243242,closed,2025-06-19T19:00:29Z,2025-06-29T15:52:31Z,https://github.com/AgentOps-AI/agentops,https://github.com/AgentOps-AI/agentops/pull/1095,"# Reduce Verbose Debug Logging Across All Instrumentation Modules

## Overview
This PR comprehensively reduces verbose debug logging across all AgentOps SDK instrumentation modules, addressing the issue identified by Dwij1704 that debug logs exist beyond just the Google ADK integration and need cleanup across all instrumentations.

## Changes Made

### Debug Log Cleanup Strategy
- **Removed operational debug logs** that provide no value to users (method wrapping success, package detection, status messages)
- **Converted error condition debug logs to warning level** for better visibility during troubleshooting
- **Preserved essential error reporting** and functionality while reducing log noise
- **Maintained all existing functionality** with improved user experience

### Files Modified (28 total)
- **Main instrumentation module** (`__init__.py`) - Removed package detection and instrumentation status debug logs
- **Agentic instrumentations**: AG2, OpenAI Agents, Google ADK, Agno, SmoLAgents
- **Provider instrumentations**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google GenAI, IBM WatsonX AI, Mem0
- **Common utilities**: instrumentor, token counting, version detection, span management
- **Stream wrappers and attribute processors** across all providers

### Impact
- **Significantly improved user experience** by reducing console log noise
- **Better error visibility** by converting critical debug logs to warning level
- **Maintained all functionality** while providing cleaner output
- **Consistent logging approach** across all instrumentation modules

## Before/After Example
**Before:**
```
DEBUG: Successfully wrapped ConversableAgent.__init__
DEBUG: Module 'openai' is a library, instrumenting 'openai'
DEBUG: Applying Google ADK patches for AgentOps instrumentation
DEBUG: Replaced tracer in google.adk.core
```

**After:**
```
INFO: OpenAI instrumentation enabled
INFO: Google ADK instrumentation enabled
```

## Testing
- ✅ All pre-commit checks pass
- ✅ Code formatting and linting applied automatically
- ✅ No functional changes to instrumentation behavior
- ✅ Comprehensive search confirms debug log removal across all modules

## Related Issues
- Addresses comprehensive debug logging cleanup as requested by Dwij1704
- Replaces PR #1088 with broader scope covering all instrumentation modules
- Improves overall SDK user experience by reducing verbose console output

3168680672,1101,OpenAI Stream Wrapper Missing Attribute Delegation Causes AttributeError,devin-ai-integration[bot],158243242,open,2025-06-23T15:53:17Z,,https://github.com/AgentOps-AI/agentops,https://github.com/AgentOps-AI/agentops/issues/1101,"# OpenAI Stream Wrapper Missing Attribute Delegation Causes AttributeError

## Problem Description
Users integrating AgentOps with ChainLit and other frameworks encounter the following error when accessing attributes on OpenAI streaming responses:

```
'OpenAIAsyncStreamWrapper' object has no attribute 'choices'
```

## Environment Details
- **AgentOps version**: 0.4.16
- **OpenAI version**: 1.90.0  
- **ChainLit version**: 2.5.5
- **Integration**: ChainLit-based chat (xpander)

## Root Cause
The `OpenAIAsyncStreamWrapper` and `OpenaiStreamWrapper` classes in `agentops/instrumentation/providers/openai/stream_wrapper.py` act as proxies around OpenAI stream objects but don't implement `__getattr__` to delegate attribute access to the underlying stream.

When code tries to access `stream.choices` or other stream attributes, Python looks for the attribute on the wrapper class, can't find it, and raises an `AttributeError`.

## Code Example
```python
def run_completion(messages: List[Any]):
    client = AsyncOpenAI(api_key=getenv(""HOSTED_ASSISTANTS_WEBUI_OPENAI_API_KEY"", """"))
    
    return client.chat.completions.create(
        messages=messages_with_current_date,
        tool_choice=""required"" if is_sub_agent else ""auto"",
        tools=xpander.agent.get_tools(),
        **settings,
    )

# This fails when AgentOps wraps the stream:
# stream.choices  # AttributeError: 'OpenAIAsyncStreamWrapper' object has no attribute 'choices'
```

## Expected Behavior
The stream wrapper should transparently proxy all attributes to the underlying OpenAI stream object, allowing users to access `choices`, `model`, `id`, `usage`, and other stream attributes without errors.

## Impact
- Breaks integration with ChainLit and other frameworks that access stream attributes
- Prevents users from accessing standard OpenAI stream response properties
- Affects both sync and async OpenAI streaming workflows

## Solution
Implement `__getattr__` method in both wrapper classes to delegate attribute access to the underlying stream object.

## Fix
**Fixed in PR #1098**: https://github.com/AgentOps-AI/agentops/pull/1098

The fix adds `__getattr__` methods to both `OpenAIAsyncStreamWrapper` and `OpenaiStreamWrapper` classes that delegate attribute access to `self._stream`, making the wrappers transparent to users while maintaining all instrumentation functionality.

3169754723,1105,OpenAI Agents SDK Guardrail Span Classification Issues,devin-ai-integration[bot],158243242,open,2025-06-23T23:46:41Z,,https://github.com/AgentOps-AI/agentops,https://github.com/AgentOps-AI/agentops/issues/1105,"# OpenAI Agents SDK Guardrail Span Classification Issues

## Problem Description

The OpenAI Agents SDK integration has issues with guardrail span classification and duplicate span creation:

1. **Incorrect Span Classification**: Guardrail events were being incorrectly classified as generic events or agent spans instead of proper `GUARDRAIL` span types
2. **Duplicate Span Creation**: Each guardrail creates 2 spans: `{guardrail_name}` and `{guardrail_name}.guardrail`, making it unclear which span represents the actual guardrail execution
3. **Lost Usage Metrics**: Recent fixes removed the wrong span, causing usage metrics to be lost from guardrail spans

## Root Cause

Two functions in the OpenAI Agents SDK instrumentation were missing handlers for `GuardrailSpanData`:

1. `get_span_kind()` in `exporter.py` - didn't handle `GuardrailSpanData`
2. `get_span_attributes()` in `attributes/common.py` - didn't have a case for `GuardrailSpanData`

## Expected Behavior

- Guardrail events should be properly classified as `GUARDRAIL` spans
- Each guardrail should create only one span with proper usage metrics
- Guardrail spans should have appropriate attributes and observability data

## Current Status

PR #1096 attempted to fix this but introduced new issues with duplicate spans and lost usage metrics.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Guardrail events are properly classified as `GUARDRAIL` span type
- [ ] No duplicate spans are created for guardrails
- [ ] Usage metrics are preserved in guardrail spans
- [ ] Proper attributes are set for guardrail spans
- [ ] Integration tests verify correct behavior

docker

### 异常情况

我使用的消息平台是napcat（它们都运行在docker中，已经按照wiki调整两者的容器网络），消息平台和LangBot之间的通讯没有问题。
api平台使用的是dify（模型名称设置在这个地方应当不会生效）
dify的地址是局域网中的另一台主机。
dify的API Endpoint：http://172.16.0.121/v1
请求运行器是：dify-service-api
当我认为万事大吉想要发送一条测试消息的时候，Langbot的日志中输出了如下内容：

### 复现步骤

1、使用docker部署LangBot和NapCat并设置容器网络。
2、启用LangBot消息适配器（aiocqhttp，host:0.0.0.0,port:2280,设置access token）
3、登录NapCat并设置ws客户端，填写[ws://](ws://langbot:2280/ws)
4、发送测试消息，验证Napcat和LangBot之间是否通讯正常，langbot是否可以接收NapCat消息
5、配置Langbot的provider，使用Dify Service Chat
6、请求运行器使用：dify-service-api
7、再次发送测试消息，验证模型请求功能

### What step the error happened?

Configuring a new connector

### Relevant information

While preparing a demo on my **Mac M4**, using **abctl**, I realized that what used to work few weeks ago no longer did. This apply to configuring a new destination as well as synching with existing connections. It took me a while to figure this one out but the problem arrived in macOS Sequoia 15.2, when Apple introduced some breaking changes when running virtualized Java. This is a well documented problem and Airbyte's  **java-connector-base 2.0.1** image already takes care of the fix.

Would it be possible now to upgrade the connector and use `docker.io/airbyte/java-connector-base:2.0.1@sha256:ec89bd1a89e825514dd2fc8730ba299a3ae1544580a078df0e35c5202c2085b3`  as the base image?

Thanks in advance,

Some of our low-code Python sources are still using Pytest 6.2+, which is _old_ and has vulnerabilities. This is not critical because they're not production builds and only dev deps, but still. We should update them.

Since we are only changing a test dependency, it's okay to put them all in a single pull request.

The easiest way to do it is to look for all `pyproject.toml` files in `airbyte-integrations/**` and make sure they all are using pytest 8+.

2908626803,55689,✨feat(source-google-drive): Introduce File Based Stream Permissions Reader,aldogonzalez8,168454423,closed,2025-03-10T23:09:13Z,2025-03-14T20:58:26Z,https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte,https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/pull/55689,"## What
Refactors the Google Drive source connector by moving permissions-related functionality from `SourceGoogleDriveStreamReader` to a dedicated `SourceGoogleDriveStreamPermissionsReader` class. 

This change follows the separation of concerns principle and aligns with the abstract base classes provided by the Airbyte CDK. 

TL;DR: we don't need to do things like [this](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/pull/55202#issuecomment-2699594478) in other connectors and want to fix this once [CDK PR](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte-python-cdk/pull/402) is merged.

Changes in CDK: https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte-python-cdk/pull/402/files

## How
- Created new `SourceGoogleDriveStreamPermissionsReader` class that implements `AbstractFileBasedStreamPermissionsReader`
- Moved permission-related methods from `SourceGoogleDriveStreamReader`:
  - `get_file_acl_permissions`
  - `load_identity_groups`
  - `file_permissions_schema`
  - `identities_schema`
- Moved supporting infrastructure:
  - Google service authentication methods
  - API response handling utilities
  - Permission-related helper functions
- No changes to the actual implementation logic, just reorganization of code

## Review guide
1. `source_google_drive/stream_permissions_reader.py` - New file containing all permissions-related functionality
2. `source_google_drive/stream_reader.py` - removal of permissions-related code


## User Impact
- No user-facing changes
- All functionality remains exactly the same
- No changes to configuration or behavior
- No performance impact

## Can this PR be safely reverted and rolled back?
- [x] YES 💚
- [ ] NO ❌

This is a pure refactoring PR that moves code without changing its behavior. Rolling back would simply move the code back to its original location without affecting functionality.

# Property Chunking Documentation for Low-Code CDK

This PR adds comprehensive documentation for the Property Chunking feature in the Airbyte low-code CDK.

## Changes Made

- **New documentation page**: Created `docs/platform/connector-development/config-based/understanding-the-yaml-file/property-chunking.md`
- **Sidebar update**: Added Property Chunking entry to the sidebar navigation under ""Understanding the YAML file""

## Documentation Content

The new documentation page includes:

- **Overview**: Explains how property chunking solves API property limitations
- **Complete schema documentation**: Covers `QueryProperties`, `PropertyChunking`, `PropertiesFromEndpoint`, and `GroupByKeyMergeStrategy`
- **Property limit types**: Documents both `characters` and `property_count` chunking strategies
- **Real-world examples**: 
  - HubSpot connector using character-based chunking (15,000 character limit)
  - LinkedIn Ads connector using property count chunking (18 property limit)
- **Record merging strategies**: Explains simple and compound key merging
- **Always include properties**: Documents properties that must be in every chunk

## Context

Property chunking is a critical feature that enables migration of important connectors like HubSpot, LinkedIn Ads, Salesforce, and Iterable from Python to low-code implementations. These connectors require the ability to split large property lists into smaller chunks due to API limitations.

## Testing

- Documentation follows the established style pattern from sibling pages like `pagination.md` and `record-selector.md`
- Schema definitions are sourced from the actual CDK implementation
- Examples are based on real connector usage patterns

To improve UI consistency, maintainability, and streamline development, we need to migrate our custom UI components to the defaults provided by Shadcn/ui. This involves replacing components currently located in `apps/next/components` with their Shadcn equivalents, which will reside in `apps/next/components/ui`.

**Current State:**

Our codebase contains a mix of:

1.  **Custom components** located directly in `apps/next/components`. These need to be replaced.
2.  **Components located in `apps/next/components/ui`**. These might already be Shadcn components or implementations closely resembling them. These should be verified against Shadcn standards and updated/replaced if necessary for full consistency.

**Migration Plan:**

1. Use shadcn@canary CLI to add components
2. Migrate all usages of existing components to the newly created ones
3. Delete the old component files after successful migration
4. Verify functionality after each component migration

*   [ ] `Input` (50+ usages)
*   [ ] `Select` (50+ combined usages with `/ui/select`) - Our Select; Switch to using Combobox instead of Shadcn's Select
*   [ ] `Combobox`  
*   [ ] `Form` (50+ usages - uses `FormSection`)
*   [ ] `Label` (~17+ usages)
*   [ ] `Select`

*   [ ] Modal
*   [ ] `Calendar / Date Picker`

Easiest to get rid of Input, FormSection, Select, Label, and the old way of doing forms/validation all at once than trying to migrate fifty usages at once, and avoids conflicts between them.

3161872621,387,Fix equity split percentage not updating when allocation is locked,devin-ai-integration[bot],158243242,closed,2025-06-20T04:21:02Z,2025-06-20T04:25:35Z,https://github.com/antiwork/flexile,https://github.com/antiwork/flexile/pull/387,"# Fix equity split percentage not updating when allocation is locked

## Problem
When submitting an invoice with a new equity split percentage (e.g., 17%), the database was not being updated with the new value. This caused the invoice edit page to continue showing the old locked equity split (e.g., 50%) instead of the newly selected percentage.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the tRPC equity allocation update route (`frontend/trpc/routes/equityAllocations.ts`). The `onConflictDoUpdate` operation had a condition `setWhere: eq(equityAllocations.locked, false)` that prevented updates when the equity allocation was already locked.

This meant that when users submitted invoices with new equity percentages:
1. The frontend would call the equity allocation update mutation
2. The update would silently fail due to the locked condition
3. The backend invoice service would read the old (unchanged) equity percentage from the database
4. The invoice would be saved with the old percentage instead of the new one

## Solution
Removed the `setWhere: eq(equityAllocations.locked, false)` condition from the equity allocation update operation. This allows equity percentage updates even when the allocation is locked, which matches the expected behavior described in PR #381 (""Allow equity split changes when allocation is locked"").

## Changes Made
- **Modified**: `frontend/trpc/routes/equityAllocations.ts`
  - Removed the `setWhere` condition that prevented updates to locked equity allocations
  - Now allows equity percentage updates regardless of locked status

## Testing Required
Since I encountered environment setup issues preventing local testing, this PR requires manual testing to verify:

1. **Create an invoice** with an initial equity split percentage (e.g., 50%)
2. **Submit the invoice** to lock the equity allocation
3. **Edit the same invoice** and change the equity split to a different percentage (e.g., 17%)
4. **Re-submit the invoice**
5. **Verify** that the invoice edit page now shows the updated percentage (17%) instead of the old one (50%)
6. **Verify** that the database contains the correct updated equity percentage

## Related
- Fixes the bug reported in Slack where equity split changes weren't persisting
- Related to PR #381 ""Allow equity split changes when allocation is locked""

3018734106,164,Bug Report — “Home” Navigation Link Never Shows Active State,MikeC-A6,77452595,closed,2025-04-25T00:51:18Z,2025-04-25T01:59:37Z,https://github.com/antiwork/gumroad,https://github.com/antiwork/gumroad/issues/164,"# Bug Report — “Home” Navigation Link Never Shows Active State

While navigating **from About back to Home**, I kept clicking **Home** because it never highlighted, so I assumed the click hadn’t worked. Every other nav item shows an active (black) state, but Home does not.

---

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Visit <https://gumroad.com> on desktop
2. Click **About** → the “About” link turns black (active)  
3. Click **Home** to return to the landing page

## Expected Result  
The “Home” link (or the logo) adopts the same black active-state styling used by “About,” “Pricing,” etc., indicating the current page.

## Actual Result  
The “Home” link remains light-gray—identical to inactive links—so users receive no visual confirmation and may assume their click failed.

---

## Root Cause

| File | Line(s) | Details |
|------|---------|---------|
| `app/javascript/components/Home/Nav.tsx` | 29-33 | Faulty comparison sets `isCurrent` |
| | 161-167 | “Home” link uses `Routes.root_url()` (absolute URL) |
| `app/javascript/components/useOriginalLocation.ts` | 5-10 | Hook returns **full absolute URL** (`window.location.href`) |
| `config/routes.rb` | root declaration | `js-routes` exports `root_url` as absolute URL |

### Faulty Logic

```ts
// Nav.tsx
const currentLocation = useOriginalLocation();                // e.g. ""https://gumroad.com/""
const isCurrent = href === new URL(currentLocation).pathname; // pathname is ""/""
...
<NavLink text=""Home"" href={Routes.root_url()} />              // ""https://gumroad.com""
```

Because `""https://gumroad.com"" !== ""/""`, `isCurrent` is **always false** for Home, so it never receives the `active` styles or `aria-current=""page""` attribute.  
All other links compare pathnames to pathnames (e.g., `""/about""`), so their active states work correctly.

---

## Suggested Fix

Compare pathnames on both sides (or use `Routes.root_path()`):

```ts
// Nav.tsx  (replace the faulty line)
const isCurrent =
  new URL(href, currentLocation).pathname === new URL(currentLocation).pathname;
```

This change gives **Home** the same `active` class and `aria-current=""page""` attribute as the other links, restoring visual consistency and meeting WCAG 2.1 navigation-orientation guidance."

3147748379,345,Update Stripe verification help text with country availability clarification,devin-ai-integration[bot],158243242,closed,2025-06-15T16:08:51Z,2025-06-24T15:36:14Z,https://github.com/antiwork/gumroad,https://github.com/antiwork/gumroad/pull/345,"# Update Stripe verification help text with country availability clarification

## Summary
Updated the Stripe verification section in the ""Getting paid by Gumroad"" help article to include additional clarification about country availability and Gumroad's partnership with Stripe.

**This PR fixes the issue from the previously closed PR #327** which targeted the old static HTML file that no longer exists after the Help Center migration to Rails ERB templates.

## Changes Made
- Added explanation that Gumroad's verified business status allows creators in supported regions to receive payouts
- Clarified that individual Stripe account availability doesn't affect the verification process  
- Added note that creators in Gumroad-supported countries should be able to verify their accounts

## Context
This update addresses user confusion about Stripe verification requirements in different countries by explaining that Gumroad's partnership with Stripe enables payouts even in regions where individual Stripe accounts may not be available.

**Previous PR #327 was closed** because it targeted `public/help/article/13-getting-paid.html` which was deleted during the Help Center migration. This PR correctly targets the new ERB template file `app/views/help_center/articles/contents/_13-getting-paid.html.erb`.

## Testing
- Verified ERB template formatting is preserved
- Content displays correctly in the help article structure
- No functional code changes - only content addition to ERB template

## Files Changed
- `app/views/help_center/articles/contents/_13-getting-paid.html.erb` - Added two paragraphs after the existing Stripe verification text

1673284305,22525,[Feature]: Option to limit connection pool size in MySQL database,felix-appsmith,114161539,closed,2023-04-18T14:43:11Z,2025-03-06T12:03:02Z,https://github.com/appsmithorg/appsmith,https://github.com/appsmithorg/appsmith/issues/22525,"### Is there an existing issue for this?

- [X] I have searched the existing issues

### Summary

When connecting to a MySQL database, the program may use multiple connections and fail to close them when they expire. This can cause issues in databases with a small limit of `max_connections` and result in `pool connection error` messages. This feature request proposes adding an option to limit the pool size of connections and handle expired connections when connecting to the database, allowing for better performance and stability.

### Why should this be worked on?

Limiting the connection pool size would help prevent the database from becoming overloaded and improve overall performance. By implementing this feature, users will be able to better manage their resources and optimize their database usage. This would also improve the overall stability of the system, reducing the risk of errors and data loss due to connection issues.

3140952082,2104,Race Condition: First Message Not Persisted Due to Timing Between `initialize()` and `append()` Calls,toddgeist,316792,closed,2025-06-12T16:41:27Z,2025-06-18T00:54:08Z,https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui,https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui/issues/2104,"Race Condition: First Message Not Persisted Due to Timing Between `initialize()` and `append()` Calls

## Problem Description

I'm implementing custom adapters for Assistant UI's `unstable_useRemoteThreadListRuntime` and encountering a race condition where the first user message in a new thread is not being persisted to the database.

## The Issue

When a user sends the first message in a new thread, the following sequence occurs:

1. `ThreadListAdapter.initialize()` is called with a local thread ID
2. `HistoryAdapter.append()` is called immediately with `remoteId: """"` (empty)
3. The message gets skipped because there's no remote ID yet
4. `initialize()` completes and returns the actual `remoteId`
5. Subsequent messages work correctly

**Console logs showing the race condition:**

```
[ThreadListAdapter] initialize() called with threadId: __LOCALID_5hCbCKl
[HistoryAdapter] append() called - remoteId: """"
[ThreadListAdapter] initialize() completed - remoteId: 122
[HistoryAdapter] append() called - remoteId: ""122""
```

## Current Implementation

### Thread List Adapter (handles thread creation)

```typescript
async initialize(threadId: string): ThreadInitializeResponsePromise {
  try {
    // Create new thread in FileMaker
    const thread = await threadService.createThread({
      name: ""New Chat"",
      threadId: threadId,
    });

    return {
      remoteId: thread.recordId,
      externalId: thread.fieldData.ThreadId,
    };
  } catch (error) {
    throw error;
  }
}
```

### History Adapter (handles message persistence)

```typescript
async append(message) {
  try {
    // If no thread ID yet, skip saving
    if (!remoteId || remoteId === """") {
      return; // ← First message gets lost here
    }

    const messageToSave = (message as any).message || message;
    await threadService.addMessageToThread(remoteId, messageToSave);
  } catch (error) {
    // Don't throw - history adapter failures shouldn't break the chat
  }
}
```

### Streaming Adapter (triggers the sequence)

```typescript
async *run({ messages, abortSignal }) {
  const firstMessage = messages.length === 1;

  // Start the FileMaker script
  if (firstMessage) {
    // Allow thread initialization to complete on next tick
    await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 500));
  }
  // ... rest of streaming logic
}
```

## What I've Tried

1. **Added delays** in the streaming adapter when it's the first message
2. **Implemented message buffering** to queue messages until `remoteId` is available
3. **Used React refs** to persist buffers across adapter recreations

Despite these attempts, the timing issue persists because `append()` is called before `initialize()` completes.

## Questions

1. **Is this expected behavior?** Should `append()` be called before `initialize()` returns?

2. **What's the recommended pattern** for handling this race condition? Should the history adapter:

   - Buffer messages until `remoteId` is available?
   - Throw an error when `remoteId` is empty?
   - Handle this differently?

3. **Is there a lifecycle hook or callback** that indicates when thread initialization is complete and the `remoteId` is available?

4. **Are there any configuration options** in the runtime that could help coordinate these calls?

## Expected Behavior

The core issue seems to be that the runtime doesn't wait for `initialize()` to complete before calling `append()` for the first message. The expected flow would be:

1. `initialize()` is called and completes
2. `remoteId` becomes available
3. `append()` is called with the valid `remoteId`
4. First message is successfully persisted

## Environment

- Assistant UI version: [latest]
- Using `unstable_useRemoteThreadListRuntime`
- Custom FileMaker backend integration

Any guidance on the intended flow or best practices would be greatly appreciated.

3033566586,21048,perf: optimize app loading and rendering performance,devin-ai-integration[bot],158243242,closed,2025-05-01T10:04:12Z,2025-05-13T15:42:58Z,https://github.com/calcom/cal.com,https://github.com/calcom/cal.com/pull/21048,"# Performance Optimizations for Cal.com

This PR implements several performance improvements to the Cal.com application:

## Changes

1. **In-memory caching system**
   - Created a simple cache utility in `@calcom/lib/cache.ts`
   - Applied caching to app registry loading functions to reduce database queries

2. **React optimizations**
   - Implemented memoization in React components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
   - Created a `MemoizedAppCard` component to optimize the app store interface
   - Used `useMemo` and `useCallback` for expensive calculations and event handlers

3. **Code splitting and lazy loading**
   - Added lazy loading with Suspense for app store components
   - Improved initial load time by deferring non-critical component loading

4. **Package optimization**
   - Added more packages to Next.js `optimizePackageImports` config for faster loading

## Note on TypeScript Error

There appears to be an existing TypeScript error in the API package that's unrelated to these performance optimizations. The error occurs in the type checking phase with:

```
Error: Debug Failure. No error for last overload signature
```

This is an internal TypeScript compiler error rather than a typical type error. We've verified that this error exists in the main branch as well and is not introduced by our changes.

This PR focuses specifically on fixing TypeScript type checking issues in the Cal.com codebase:

1. **Fixed null check in TeamsListing component**
   - Added optional chaining to handle null searchParams in TeamsListing.tsx
   - This prevents TypeScript errors when searchParams could be null

2. **Properly handles TypeScript type checking**
   - Fixed the type checking process without skipping checks
   - Ensures proper type safety throughout the codebase

## Background

There was an issue where type checking was being skipped in the CI process. This PR properly fixes the underlying TypeScript errors rather than bypassing the checks, ensuring better code quality and type safety.

Note: The performance optimizations mentioned in previous PRs (caching, memoization, etc.) are in PR #21048, while this PR focuses solely on fixing the TypeScript type checking issues.

3042979666,21137,perf: Optimize team bookings query by fetching data for multiple users at once,devin-ai-integration[bot],158243242,closed,2025-05-06T14:08:17Z,2025-05-06T18:47:07Z,https://github.com/calcom/cal.com,https://github.com/calcom/cal.com/pull/21137,"# Optimize Team Bookings Query and Busy Times Limits

This PR optimizes the team bookings query and busy times limits by fetching data for multiple users at once, rather than making separate database calls for each user.

## Changes

1. Added a new `getAllAcceptedTeamBookingsOfUsers` function in BookingRepository that accepts multiple users
2. Created a new `getBusyTimesFromTeamLimitsForUsers` function in util.ts that processes team booking limits for multiple users
3. Added a new `getBusyTimesFromLimitsForUsers` function in util.ts that processes booking and duration limits for multiple users
4. Moved the condition checks from getUserAvailability.ts to util.ts
5. Updated the GetUserAvailabilityInitialData type to include teamBookingLimits, teamForBookingLimits, busyTimesFromLimits, and eventTypeForLimits properties
6. Modified the _getUserAvailability function to use the batch-loaded data from initialData when available

## Benefits

- Reduces the number of database queries by fetching team bookings and busy times once for multiple users
- Improves performance by avoiding redundant database calls
- Maintains the same functionality while optimizing query execution
- Particularly beneficial for team and collective scheduling types with many members

## Testing

- Verified that all type checks pass with `yarn type-check:ci`

This PR refactors the duplicated code between `getBusyTimesFromLimits.ts` and `util.ts` into reusable utility functions. The main changes include:

## What's Changed

- Created a new utility file `packages/lib/intervalLimits/utils.ts` with three key functions:
  - `extractDateParameters` - Extracts date parameters from a booking and period
  - `isBookingWithinPeriod` - Checks if a booking is within a given period
  - `getUnitFromBusyTime` - Determines the appropriate interval limit unit

- Updated both `getBusyTimesFromLimits.ts` and `util.ts` to use these new utility functions, removing duplicated code.

## Testing

- ✅ Type checking passes with `yarn type-check:ci`
- ✅ Tests pass with `TZ=UTC yarn test`

## Related PR

This PR is built on top of PR #21137 and consolidates the duplicated code introduced in that PR.

2971354746,1967,[Bug] Missing consistent handling of image volume loading completed,pcanas,32467089,open,2025-04-04T05:59:40Z,,https://github.com/cornerstonejs/cornerstone3D,https://github.com/cornerstonejs/cornerstone3D/issues/1967,"### Describe the Bug

Related to https://github.com/cornerstonejs/cornerstone3D/issues/1924

After Cornerstone v3 upgrade, we are missing a consistent handler when an image volume loading has been completed. We are working with the Nifti Loader, and the behaviour we have experience is the following:

- Event `NIFTI_VOLUME_LOADED`: gets triggered after the header parsing. In the event of a first load, this event gets triggered way sooner than what it should (the image has not completed loading). So we need to rely on `IMAGE_VOLUME_LOADING_COMPLETED`
- Event `IMAGE_VOLUME_LOADING_COMPLETED` works just fine for a first load. However, it does not get triggered on subsequent loads. Therefore, for re-opening and already loaded case, we need to rely on the event `NIFTI_VOLUME_LOADED` which does get triggered.

We would like to ask whether we are missing any event that can consistently handle image loads for all scenarios (first and subsequent loads).

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Open an image with the Nifti Loader. 
2. Re-open the same image (already cached).

### The current behavior

1. Open an image with the Nifti Loader -> `NIFTI_VOLUME_LOADED` gets triggered way to early, `IMAGE_VOLUME_LOADING_COMPLETED` gets triggered when expected.
2. Re-open the same image (already cached) -> `IMAGE_VOLUME_LOADING_COMPLETED` does not get triggered. `NIFTI_VOLUME_LOADED` appears to get triggered just on time when cornerstone loads the cached image.

### The expected behavior

Consistent launch of events.

All

Whilst all the tasks, agents, tools information is passed to the planning agent as part of the crew set-up, it seems that any knowledge which is pre-loaded isn't included - this could have important information which may guide the planning process decisions so I think it should be passed as part of this process.

2760290080,1804,fix: Change storage initialization to None for KnowledgeStorage,ericklima-ca,73451993,closed,2024-12-27T01:54:56Z,2024-12-28T00:18:25Z,https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI,https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/1804,"This pull request includes changes to the `Knowledge` and `BaseKnowledgeSource` classes in the `crewai` module to modify the default value for the `storage` field. The key changes are as follows:

Changes to `Knowledge` and `BaseKnowledgeSource` classes:

* [`src/crewai/knowledge/knowledge.py`](diffhunk://#diff-38a86d921e4961add0bdf8d161d08ddd84b6ea8e79a47a797372d7ab46b08109L23-R23): Changed the default value of the `storage` field in the `Knowledge` class to `None` instead of using `KnowledgeStorage`.

### Conclusion
The eager initialization of `KnowledgeStorage` occurs before any custom embedder configuration is passed to its constructor. As a result, the `KnowledgeStorage` class attempts to initialize with the default OpenAI settings, leading to the following error:
```txt
ValueError: Please provide an OpenAI API key. You can get one at https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys
An error occurred while running the crew: Command '['uv', 'run', 'run_crew']' returned non-zero exit status 1.
```
With this change, the `storage` field defaults to `None`, preventing any default factory initialization."
2762672420,1817,Agent() Parameter Name Inconsistency (llm vs LLM),srishrachamalla7,78019070,closed,2024-12-30T05:34:21Z,2025-02-04T12:17:05Z,https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI,https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/1817,"### Description

There is a bug in the Agent() class where the parameter name for specifying the language model (llm) is case-sensitive, leading to unexpected behavior:

1. Using llm=llm works correctly with a custom LLM (e.g., Ollama).
2. Using LLM=llm causes the system to fallback to OpenAI's LLM, prompting for an API key (liteLLM error).

This inconsistency causes confusion and may lead to unintended fallback behavior.



### Steps to Reproduce

1. Define a custom LLM instance:
  ```
  llm = LLM(
  model=""ollama/phi3:latest"",
  base_url=""http://localhost:11434""
  )
  ```
2. Create an Agent() using:

-       Correct Usage: llm=llm (works as expected).
-       Incorrect Usage: LLM=llm (causes fallback to OpenAI).

3. Observe the behavior.

### Expected behavior

The Agent() class should:

1. Enforce a consistent parameter naming convention.
2. Throw an error or warning if an unsupported parameter (LLM) is passed.

### Screenshots/Code snippets

- When LLM=llm is used, the system ignores the custom LLM and defaults to OpenAI's LLM, prompting for an API key.

### Operating System

Windows 11

### Python Version

3.12

### crewAI Version

0.86.0

### crewAI Tools Version

0.17.0

### Virtual Environment

### Possible Solution

The issue can be resolved by:

1. Standardizing the parameter name in the Agent() class to llm across all usage scenarios.
2. Adding a validation step in the Agent() initialization to raise an error or warning if an unsupported parameter like LLM is used.
4. Updating the documentation to clearly state that llm is the correct parameter name.

### Additional context

This issue is critical for users integrating custom LLMs like Ollama and can lead to unnecessary fallback to OpenAI if not addressed."

2816946225,1994,[BUG] Ollama embedder expecting wrong (?) key in embedder config,jaimesalazarlahera,57615129,closed,2025-01-29T00:00:38Z,2025-02-18T16:31:48Z,https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI,https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/1994,"### Description

I was getting connection refused errors when adding an ollama embedder. I finally realized the [ollama embedding configurator](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/blob/c3e7a3ec1936fda43428ff13a3fd101f483db6af/src/crewai/utilities/embedding_configurator.py#L91) was asking the config for a `""url""` key when I was trying with `""api_url""` , `""base_url""` , `""api_base""` , etc. I couldn't find much in the docs about this.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd0dc96c-3204-42fc-8edb-651c4edf0e92)


Note: I need the url to be `ollama:11434` instead of `localhost:11434` because ollama is the docker container.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Add a knowledge source to an agent.
2. Add the embedder to an agent. Try any of the documented examples of the ollama embedder config. For example:

```
{
    ""provider"": ""ollama"",
    ""config"": {
        ""model"": ""mxbai-embed-large"",
        ""api_url"":  ""http://ollama:11434""
    }
}
```

3. Run `crewai run` and notice it will only take your config value if the key is `url`.

### Expected behavior

For it to be documented better?

### Screenshots/Code snippets

This was causing my `_session.post() `to error out:

Function `'test()` in `class Crew(BaseModel)` expects as input parameter `openai_model_name: Optional[str] = None,`

However, this would not apply if an agent refers to a model different from an OpenAI model; in that case testing would not be performed with the chosen model for the agent, but with an OpenAI model instead.

I'd expect that the model running an agent is the same as testing the agent. Why does `test()` not take a parameter `llm` as e.g. `Agent()` does?

Thank you.

2840826308,2068,feat: implement hierarchical agent delegation with allowed_agents parameter,Vardaan-Grover,67010021,open,2025-02-09T17:25:44Z,,https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI,https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2068,"## Overview
Enhances CrewAI's delegation system by introducing controlled hierarchical agent structures through the `allowed_agents` parameter.

## Current State
- Agents can delegate tasks using `allow_delegation=True`
- The given agent has access to delegate to any other agent within the crew with no limitations
- No hierarchy or access control in delegation flow
- As the number of agents increase within a crew, delegation becomes more and more unreliable and inconsistent

## New Feature
Adds `allowed_agents` parameter to Agent class:
```python
agent = Agent(
    role=""Executive Director"",
    allow_delegation=True,
    allowed_agents=[""Communications Manager"", ""Research Manager""]
)
```

## Visual Representation
![WhatsApp Image 2025-02-09 at 19 53 22](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9af8d96f-1ef3-4e3a-aed5-d8f240f573bd)

## Benefits
- Controlled Delegation: Agents can only delegate to specified subordinates
- Hierarchical Structure: Enables multi-level organizational hierarchies
- Reduced Choice Paralysis: Agents make decisions from a focused subset
- Better Specialization: Clear delegation paths for specific tasks
- Improved Reliability: Consistent delegation patterns

## Example Usage
```python
# Top-level management
executive = Agent(
    role=""Executive Director"",
    allow_delegation=True,
    allowed_agents=[""Communications Manager"", ""Research Manager""]
)

# Mid-level management
comms_manager = Agent(
    role=""Communications Manager"",
    allow_delegation=True,
    allowed_agents=[""Email Agent"", ""Social Media Agent""]
)

# Specialized workers
email_agent = Agent(
    role=""Email Agent"",
    allow_delegation=False
)

crew = Crew(
    agents=[executive, comms_manager, email_agent],
    tasks=[task]
)
```
This pull request includes several changes to improve the delegation capabilities of agents and refactor related code. The most important changes include adding a new `allowed_agents` field to the `BaseAgent` class, updating the delegation logic, and enhancing the delegation tool's execution.

## Technical Changes

### Enhancements to agent delegation:

* [`src/crewai/agents/agent_builder/base_agent.py`](diffhunk://#diff-3741f76ea8e0814473fe9c08098035a30cb5215777e7e2c2f8e4ff305604255bR115-R118): Added a new `allowed_agents` field to the `BaseAgent` class to specify which agents an agent can delegate tasks to.
* [`src/crewai/agents/agent_builder/base_agent.py`](diffhunk://#diff-3741f76ea8e0814473fe9c08098035a30cb5215777e7e2c2f8e4ff305604255bR260-R265): Introduced a `validate_allowed_agents` method to ensure the `allowed_agents` field contains valid agent roles or instances.

### Refactoring delegation logic:

* [`src/crewai/crew.py`](diffhunk://#diff-61064eabfbcf89548f1d4f5e2e18616dea6e897d06dc0a00bad1eebd634dc9caL865-R886): Refactored the `_add_delegation_tools` method to use the new `allowed_agents` field and added debug prints to trace the delegation process.
* [`src/crewai/tools/agent_tools/base_agent_tools.py`](diffhunk://#diff-01d4e1f6c0fe4606669ccaf4dc686a3805942cb7a1b47e5bbc817b94b672773dL55-R96): Simplified the `_execute` method by removing redundant code and improving the delegation process with better logging and error handling."
2840922653,2069,feat: implement hierarchical agent delegation with allowed_agents parameter,devin-ai-integration[bot],158243242,closed,2025-02-09T20:02:37Z,2025-02-09T23:16:07Z,https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI,https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2069,"# Hierarchical Agent Delegation with allowed_agents Parameter

This PR implements hierarchical agent delegation by adding an `allowed_agents` parameter to control which agents can delegate tasks to which other agents. This improves reliability and consistency of delegation in large crews by enforcing organizational hierarchies.

## Changes
- Added `allowed_agents` parameter to BaseAgent
- Added validation for allowed_agents list
- Updated delegation tools to respect allowed_agents restrictions
- Added error messages for unauthorized delegation
- Added tests for hierarchical delegation

## Example Usage
```python
# Top-level management
executive = Agent(
    role=""Executive Director"",
    allow_delegation=True,
    allowed_agents=[""Communications Manager"", ""Research Manager""]
)

# Mid-level management
comms_manager = Agent(
    role=""Communications Manager"",
    allow_delegation=True,
    allowed_agents=[""Email Agent"", ""Social Media Agent""]
)

# Specialized workers
email_agent = Agent(
    role=""Email Agent"",
    allow_delegation=False
)

crew = Crew(
    agents=[executive, comms_manager, email_agent],
    tasks=[task]
)
```

## Test Results
All tests pass, including new tests for hierarchical delegation:
- test_delegate_work_with_allowed_agents
- test_delegate_work_with_unauthorized_agent

## Documentation
The `allowed_agents` parameter is a list of agent roles that an agent is allowed to delegate tasks to. When set, the agent can only delegate to agents whose roles are in this list. This enables creating hierarchical structures where:
- Top-level managers can delegate to mid-level managers
- Mid-level managers can delegate to specialized workers
- Specialized workers cannot delegate

2840926622,2070,feat: implement hierarchical agent delegation with allowed_agents parameter,devin-ai-integration[bot],158243242,closed,2025-02-09T20:10:46Z,2025-02-09T23:16:08Z,https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI,https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2070,"# Hierarchical Agent Delegation with allowed_agents Parameter

This PR implements hierarchical agent delegation by adding an `allowed_agents` parameter to control which agents can delegate tasks to which other agents. This improves reliability and consistency of delegation in large crews by enforcing organizational hierarchies.

## Changes
- Added `allowed_agents` parameter to BaseAgent
- Added validation for allowed_agents list
- Updated delegation tools to respect allowed_agents restrictions
- Added error messages for unauthorized delegation
- Added tests for hierarchical delegation

## Example Usage
```python
# Top-level management
executive = Agent(
    role=""Executive Director"",
    allow_delegation=True,
    allowed_agents=[""Communications Manager"", ""Research Manager""]
)

# Mid-level management
comms_manager = Agent(
    role=""Communications Manager"",
    allow_delegation=True,
    allowed_agents=[""Email Agent"", ""Social Media Agent""]
)

# Specialized workers
email_agent = Agent(
    role=""Email Agent"",
    allow_delegation=False
)

crew = Crew(
    agents=[executive, comms_manager, email_agent],
    tasks=[task]
)
```

## Test Results
All tests pass, including new tests for hierarchical delegation:
- test_delegate_work_with_allowed_agents
- test_delegate_work_with_unauthorized_agent
- test_delegate_work_without_allowed_agents

## Documentation
The `allowed_agents` parameter is a list of agent roles that an agent is allowed to delegate tasks to. When set, the agent can only delegate to agents whose roles are in this list. This enables creating hierarchical structures where:
- Top-level managers can delegate to mid-level managers
- Mid-level managers can delegate to specialized workers
- Specialized workers cannot delegate

2844953833,2095,[FEATURE] Add better coworkers context for crews with managers,Saicheg,624999,closed,2025-02-11T10:24:45Z,2025-02-18T17:07:08Z,https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI,https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/2095,"### Feature Area

### Is your feature request related to a an existing bug? Please link it here.

NA

### Describe the solution you'd like

Hi there!

Before making a suggestion just let me take a quick work and thank you for this amazing framework. I fall in love with simplicity and power of it a minute I found it. 

Lately I am wrapping my head around crews with managers. Recently I discovered that the way ""management"" is done is just by assigning two tools in order to allow manager to delegate a work.

```
Tool Name: Delegate work to coworker
Tool Arguments: {'task': {'description': 'The task to delegate', 'type': 'str'}, 'context': {'description': 'The context for the task', 'type': 'str'}, 'coworker': {'description': 'The role/name of the coworker to delegate to', 'type': 'str'}}
Tool Description: Delegate a specific task to one of the following coworkers: News and Trend Researcher, Assistant, Topic Researcher
The input to this tool should be the coworker, the task you want them to do, and ALL necessary context to execute the task, they know nothing about the task, so share absolute everything you know, don't reference things but instead explain them.

Tool Name: Ask question to coworker
Tool Arguments: {'question': {'description': 'The question to ask', 'type': 'str'}, 'context': {'description': 'The context for the question', 'type': 'str'}, 'coworker': {'description': 'The role/name of the coworker to ask', 'type': 'str'}}
Tool Description: Ask a specific question to one of the following coworkers: News and Trend Researcher, Assistant, Topic Researcher
```

Problem for me was that in current implementation default manager can only understand which coworker to ask by their name. There is no additional context about coworkers goals/descriptions which will affect manager description. This means if you have 3 agents ( Researcher, Quick Researcher, Deep Researcher ) for example - manager will be very confused.  

I would love to have a way to describe coworkers to manager with better context other that just name. It could be by including their descriptions /goals or having additional field for manager like `manager_notes:`.

### Describe alternatives you've considered

The way I am solving this right now is by creating fully-custom manager with JSON description for each of my agents. But it is a little messy and I believe should be something by default in framework:

```
    @property
    def manager(self) -> Agent:
        return Agent(
            allow_delegation=True,
            role=""Crew Manager"",
            goal=""Manage the team to complete the task in the best way possible."",
            backstory=dedent(
                """"""
                You are a seasoned manager with a knack for getting the best out of your team.
                You are also known for your ability to delegate work to the right coworkers, and to ask the right questions to get the best out of your team.
                Even though you don't perform tasks by yourself, you have a lot of experience in the field, which allows you to properly evaluate the work of your team members.

                Below is JSON description for your coworkwers abilities:
                {coworkers_prompt}
                """"""
            ).format(coworkers_prompt=self.coworkers_prompt).strip(),
        )

```

2847278927,2102,[BUG] AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'skip_auto_end_session' during crew.kickoff() cleanup,ashishpatel26,3095771,closed,2025-02-12T06:12:56Z,2025-02-18T19:33:38Z,https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI,https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/2102,"### Description

When running a crew using the Gemini-based LLM integration, the execution completes the tasks successfully but fails during the session termination phase. The error occurs in the cleanup code (inside `agentops.end_session`), where an attempt is made to access the attribute `skip_auto_end_session` on a configuration object that is unexpectedly `None`.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Create a `.env` file with your `GOOGLE_API_KEY` (or ensure the environment variable is set).  
2. Use the following code to create two agents (a ""Senior Researcher"" and a ""Writer"") that share the same LLM instance (initialized via CrewAI’s `LLM` and the Google Gemini integration) and use the `SerperDevTool` tool.  
3. Define two tasks—one for the researcher and one for the writer.  
4. Create a Crew with the agents and tasks, then call `crew.kickoff(inputs={'topic': 'AI in automotive'})`.

### Expected behavior

The crew should complete execution and terminate the session cleanly without encountering an AttributeError.

### Possible Solution

**Request:**  
Please advise on how to either properly set up the configuration so that `skip_auto_end_session` is available or how to ignore/suppress this error if it is benign. Any suggestions on workarounds or fixes would be appreciated.

### Additional context

**Additional Notes:**  
- The error appears during the final cleanup (session termination) via a call to `agentops.end_session()`.  
- It seems that the configuration object (`self.config`) expected by the client is `None` at that point.

2855891327,2145,"[BUG] Interpolation of inputs is failing when tool descriptions are added to agent backstory (same would apply to goal, role, description, etc.)",asehmi,138668,closed,2025-02-16T05:23:27Z,2025-03-24T12:17:15Z,https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI,https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/2145,"### Description

After creating my agents from yaml, I do this:
```
agent_.backstory = agent_.backstory + f""""""
The tools you have at your disposal are:
- SerperDevTool: {search_tool.description}
- ScrapeWebsiteTool: {scrape_tool.description}
""""""
```

However the descriptions contain braces, for example:

```
$ print(scrape_tool.description)

""Tool Name: Read website content\nTool Arguments: {'website_url': {'description': 'Mandatory website url to read the file', 'type': 'str'}}\nTool Description: A tool that can be used to read a website content.""
```

And this causes interpolation to fail as the keys ""'website_url'"" and ""'description'"" are not part of my kickoff inputs dictionary (note the literal single quotes in those so called ""keys"").

My workaround has been to do a string replace on the tool descriptions of curly braces with square braces. Seems like there is a bug in the interpolator or some defensive hardening is in order to prevent this. 

### Steps to Reproduce

Try adding this to your agent:
```
agent_.backstory = agent_.backstory + f""""""
The tools you have at your disposal are:
- SerperDevTool: {search_tool.description}
- ScrapeWebsiteTool: {scrape_tool.description}
""""""

Interpolation should not be confused by tool descriptions which contain dict strings.

### Possible Solution

Sub classes of `BaseTool` invoke `model_post_init()` which changes the original description. This is adding an args schema of the field names and their descriptions. Perhaps this function can be modified to prevent this edge case.

Problem:
- String interpolation fails when tool descriptions containing curly braces are added to agent properties

Solution:
- Add _interpolate_only helper method to escape curly braces
- Update interpolate_inputs to use new helper
- Add test case for tool descriptions

Testing:
- Added test case specifically for tool descriptions with curly braces
- All existing tests pass
- Linting passes

Core functionality

### Is your feature request related to a an existing bug? Please link it here.

Currently if you use `pydantic_output` for task it will include instructions to LLM like this:

Schema: 

```
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class ResponseLimit(BaseModel):
    min_words: int
    max_words: int
    reason: str
```

Instructions:

```
Ensure your final answer contains only the content in the following format: {
  ""min_words"": int,
  ""max_words"": int,
  ""reason"": str
}
```

However if i try to add some details for pydantic_output similar what we do for tools with `args_schema` like this:

Schema with descriptions:

```
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class ResponseLimit(BaseModel):
    min_words: int = Field(..., description=""Minimum number of words"")
    max_words: int = Field(..., description=""Maximum number of words"")
    reason: str = Field(..., description=""Reason this decision is made."")

```

It will still have the same instructions as listed above. 


### Describe the solution you'd like

I would love for tool to detect if `Fields` are assigned and include it as JSON schema, something like that:

```
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class ResponseLimit(BaseModel):
    min_words: int = Field(..., description=""Minimum number of words"")
    max_words: int = Field(..., description=""Maximum number of words"")
    reason: str = Field(..., description=""Reason this decision is made"")

```

It will include instructions like this: 

```
Ensure your final answer follows this JSON schema: {
  ""min_words"": {'description': 'Minimum number of words', 'type': 'int'},
  ""max_words"": {'description': 'Maximum number of words', 'type': 'int'},
  ""reason"": {'description': 'Reason this decision is made', 'type': 'str'},
}
```

### Describe alternatives you've considered

Of cause you can always manually describe on `expected_output` each field, but it would be nice if you don't have to do that and it is taken from `pydantic ouput` as well.

2869706406,2194,[BUG] Mistral LLM Fails with Tools Due to Role Expectation,QuanticPotatoes,7420853,closed,2025-02-21T18:12:08Z,2025-04-11T17:54:25Z,https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI,https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/2194,"### Description

When using crewai with Mistral (mistral/mistral-large-latest) and adding a Tool on the agent, the request fails with an error stating that the last role is not correctly set.


### Steps to Reproduce

- Clone the crewAI repo
- Install deps
```
uv lock
uv sync
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```
- Creating a test using the LLM(model=""mistral/mistral-large-latest"")
```
uv run pytest tests/mistral_test.py
```


### Expected behavior

Using the correct role with mistral API when the agent has a tool

### Screenshots/Code snippets

The test i used to reproduce it on crewAI repo :

```python
import pytest
from unittest.mock import MagicMock
from crewai.agent import Agent
from crewai.crew import Crew
from crewai.llm import LLM
from crewai.task import Task
from crewai.process import Process
from crewai.tools import BaseTool

class DummyTool (BaseTool):

    name: str = ""Dummy tool""
    description: str = ""Return a dummy output""

    def __init__ (self, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)

    def _run (self):
        return ""Dummy output""

# Fixture to set up the Mistral LLM
@pytest.fixture
def test_mistral():
    llm = LLM(model=""mistral/mistral-large-latest"", api_key=""*****"")
    return llm

# Dummy agent for testing
def create_dummy_agent(llm):
    dummy_tool = DummyTool()
    agent = Agent(
        role=""Dummy Agent"",
        goal=""Perform dummy task"",
        backstory=""This agent is designed to perform a dummy task for testing purposes."",
        tools=[dummy_tool],
        llm=llm,
        verbose=True
    )
    return agent

# Dummy task for testing
def create_dummy_task(agent):
    task = Task(
        description=""This is a dummy task. Please return 'Task completed.'"",
        expected_output=""Task completed."",
        agent=agent
    )
    return task

# Test function to verify the dummy task execution
def test_dummy_task_execution(test_mistral):
    # Create a dummy agent with the Mistral LLM
    dummy_agent = create_dummy_agent(test_mistral)

    # Create a dummy task for the agent
    dummy_task = create_dummy_task(dummy_agent)

    # Create a Crew with the dummy agent and task
    crew = Crew(
        agents=[dummy_agent],
        tasks=[dummy_task],
        verbose=True,
        max_rpm=360,
        process=Process.sequential
    )

    # Execute the task and assert the output
    result = crew.kickoff()
    assert str(result) == ""Task completed.""

Error during LLM call: litellm.BadRequestError: MistralException - Error code: 400 - {'object': 'error', 'message': 'Expected last role User or Tool (or Assistant with prefix True) for serving but got assistant', 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': None, 'code': None}
```

### Possible Solution

I've added :
```python
        if ""mistral"" in self.model.lower():
            for message in messages:
                if message.get(""role"") == ""assistant"":
                    message[""role""] = ""system""

I've tried this about 5 times now. Each time I choose Mistral, the provider is never actually set up. I am just using the Crewai create project.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. createa. new project follow the instructions
2. Choose 12 other
3. Choose 25 - mistral
4. When you are using the project its not clear if its setting any thing up, only way to get it to work is to use a custom LLM wrapper, but that is causing issues.

### Expected behavior

It should setup to use mistral.

I have implemented a custom tool which asks questions generated by agent and waits for answer through websocket , my issue agent calling tool with same question twice,

here is my implementation

import asyncio
from typing import Type, Union

from crewai.tools import BaseTool
from fastapi import WebSocket
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, ConfigDict


class QuestionAskingToolInput(BaseModel):
    """"""Input schema for QuestionAskingTool.""""""
    question: str = Field(..., description='question for context')

class QuestionsAskingTool(BaseTool):
    name: str = ""Human Input Tool""
    description: str = ""Ask questions and get answers""
    args_schema: Type[BaseModel] = QuestionAskingToolInput

    model_config = ConfigDict(arbitrary_types_allowed=True)

    def __init__(self, websocket: WebSocket):
        super().__init__()
        self._websocket = websocket

    def _run(self, question: str) -> str:

        print(question)
        async def send_question_and_receive_answer():
              await self._websocket.send_json({""question"": question})
              response = await asyncio.wait_for(
                    self._websocket.receive_text(),
                  timeout= 180                )

        try:
                loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
        except RuntimeError:
                loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()
                asyncio.set_event_loop(loop)


        answer = loop.run_until_complete(send_question_and_receive_answer())

        return answer




    def _arun(self, question: Union[str, dict]) -> str:
        raise NotImplementedError(""This tool only supports synchronous operations"")

### Steps to Reproduce

create any agent to generate questions on any topic  to use tool , 
you will see that agent call the tool again with same question ,eventhough new question has been generated.


### Expected behavior

tool should be called and after getting output should be done with it or call tool with new input

### Screenshots/Code snippets

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df2b47a9-7004-44f3-9356-9bdcd0458e0e)
 
This is the verbose , as you can see after task started ,the print statement used in tool is triggered once ,then after websocket receives , the print statement of question is again getting triggered, and same question is sent through websocket

This is up to your preferences, but I noticed that I got various warnings raised by ruff/black after creating the default project.

For example:
* The imports were not sorted according to isort ordering
* `typing.Type` is deprecated, use `type` instead
* class MyProject(): / class LatestAiDevelopmentCrew(): <- remove the parentheses



### Steps to Reproduce

1. Install ruff with this configuration:

[tool.ruff]
line-length = 120
target-version = ""py310""
select = [""E"", ""F"", ""I"", ""UP"", ""A""]
ignore = [""D203""]

I'm triyng to setup a crew / agents based on Azure OpenAI models. I'm getting parsing errors and hence want to use json mode.

Trying to setup llms with response format leads me to an error:
```
llm = LLM(
    model=f""azure/{SECRETS['AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAMES'][0]}"",
    api_key=SECRETS['AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY'],
    api_base=SECRETS['AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT'],
    api_version=""2025-01-01-preview"",
    response_format={""type"": ""json_object""}
)

regulatory_researcher_agent = Agent(
    config=agents_config['regulatory_researcher_agent'],
    llm=llm
)
...
```

Error:
```
 Error during LLM call: The model azure/gpt-4o does not support response_format for provider 'azure'. Please remove response_format or use a supported model.
 An unknown error occurred. Please check the details below.
 Error details: The model azure/gpt-4o does not support response_format for provider 'azure'. Please remove response_format or use a supported model.
```

I am using `gpt-4o-2024-11-20` which according to documentation should support json mode. Why is this not working? Could you enable it for the supported AzureOpenAI models? Or how can I use it for the output of my agents?

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6cad253a-c06c-4d94-a6fc-ac6186e818e2)

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Deploy AzureOpenAi Model supporting JSON Mode e.g. `gpt-4o-2024-11-20`
2. Setup 
```
llm = LLM(
    model=f""azure/{SECRETS['AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAMES'][0]}"",
    api_key=SECRETS['AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY'],
    api_base=SECRETS['AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT'],
    api_version=""2025-01-01-preview"",
    response_format={""type"": ""json_object""}
)
# random crew

### Expected behavior

Agents returning parsed json objects

If you use `@CrewBase`, and then access `self.agents` or `self.tasks`, you will get an error saying that these don't exist. Why isn't `CrewBase` a class/metaclass to be inherited ?


I also struggle to understand the benefit of using `CrewBase` as we could just create a function that returns the crew if that's needed. I have the same issue with `Knowledge` over `Tools`. This would be great if that was specified in the documentation.

The documentation is currently only examples, if I take the page of tools, we don't have a view on what options are availables.



### Steps to Reproduce

1. Use `@CrewBase`
2. Access `self.agents` or `self.tasks`
3. you will get an error saying that these don't exist.

We have Enterprise LLM Gateway which encapsulates External Endpoints of several LLMs. Instead of API Key based authentication, we have JWT based authentication.

When I try to inherit the crewai.LLM class and override call method and removed the dependency of litellm. When We tried the sample research agent. we get the following error

Error:
AuthenticationError: litellm.AuthenticationError: AuthenticationError: OpenAIException - The api_key client option must be set either by passing api_key to the client or by setting the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable



Is there a way CrewAI provides a functionality similar to langchain_core.language_models.chat_models.BaseChatModel

Agent capabilities

### Is your feature request related to a an existing bug? Please link it here.

NA

### Describe the solution you'd like

Right now, when memory is turned on, all types of memory is stored locally using chroma or sqlite. Even when you opt in to use something like mem0, the other types of memory are still being stored locally. I would like there to be an option to extend the memory storage class and pass that as the memory store for an agent/crew. This would allow for more finetuning and control of agent memory.

The solution could be as simple as exposing a memory storage parameter for the crew/agent.

### Describe alternatives you've considered

I've considered to add support for self managed mem0 instances, for example using a self managed vector store with mem0, but that would only solve part of the problem. I think giving the developer the power to fully manage how memories are stored/retrieved would be incredibly valuable.

2895771981,2282,[BUG] output_json not working with custom_openai,WoBuGs,5580042,closed,2025-03-05T00:26:11Z,2025-05-18T14:59:55Z,https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI,https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/2282,"### Description

I have a setup with Ollama and Open-WebUI. Agents do some tasks, and then output a json file.

I ensure that the output is valid by using the `output_json` parameter in my task definition:

```python
    @task
    def my_task(self) -> Task:
        return Task(
            config=self.tasks_config['my_task'],
            tools=[],
            output_file=""outputs/task_output.json"",
            output_json=TaskOutput
        )
```

So far I used Ollama as model provider in my crews. Now I want to move everything to the OpenAI-compatible API from Open-WebUI, to handle users, API keys, etc.

For testing, I have the following two ini files:

```ini
MODEL=ollama/granite3.2:8b
BASE_URL=http://<ollama url>:11434
```

and

```ini
OPENAI_MODEL_NAME=custom_openai/granite3.2:8b
OPENAI_API_BASE=https://<openwebui url>/ollama/v1
OPENAI_API_KEY=<API key>
```

The crew runs for both, BUT for the second one, I get the following error at the end of the exection:

```
 Failed to convert text into JSON, error: Instructor does not support multiple tool calls, use List[Model] instead. Using raw output instead.
```

The outputed JSON file is not valid, and this last steps hangs for a few minutes.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Set up a task with the `output_json` parameter.
2. Run the task using ollama as backend.
3. Run the task using openwebui (OpenAI-compatible API) as backend.

### Expected behavior

Valid JSON and not error.

My agent use simple tool which has only one parameter with wrong way.
for example:
```python
@tool
def stock_info(ticker: str):
    """"""Useful to get stock infomation.(e.g. market cap, beta, 52-week high, 52-week low, etc.)
    
    Args:
        ticker: The ticker of a company. str
    """"""
    ticker = yf.Ticker(ticker)
    return ticker.info
```
**This tool's input should be** : {""ticker"": ""VST""}

But sometimes **input become**: [{""ticker"": ""VST""}, {""tool_code"": ""Stock Info"", ""tool_input"": {""ticker"": ""VST""}}]

Full message from step callback is as follow:
`
Tool Used: Stock Info
  
Tool input: [{""ticker"": ""VST""}, {""tool_code"": ""Stock Info"", ""tool_input"": {""ticker"": ""VST""}}]
  
Message: Thought:Okay, let's start by getting the stock information for Vistra Corp (VST) using the 'Stock Info' tool to get some initial parameters. Action: Stock Info Action Input: {""ticker"": ""VST""}
  
tool_code
{""tool_code"": ""Stock Info"", ""tool_input"": {""ticker"": ""VST""}}
  
Observation: Error: the Action Input is not a valid key, value dictionary.
`


### Steps to Reproduce

1. Use tool with agent

### Expected behavior

Agent use tool with correct way.

### Screenshots/Code snippets

```python
@tool
def stock_info(ticker: str):
    """"""Useful to get stock infomation.(e.g. market cap, beta, 52-week high, 52-week low, etc.)
    
    Args:

			expectations_investing,
			#websiteSearchTool,
			#scrape_tool,
		],
		step_callback=lambda step: self.step_callback(step, ""Quantitative Analyst 2"")
	)
```

My quantative agent use 6~7 tools to calculate stock value.
```yaml
quantitative_analyst_task:
  description: >
    Calculate the Expectations Investing Result of the {company}'s stock.
    Use the provided tools to gather the key financial data which is used to calculate the WACC and Expectations Investing Result.:
      - Obtain the specific macroeconomic data with the Macro Economic Data tool.
      - Obtain the {company}'s info data with the Stock Info tool.
      - Obtain the {company}'s basic financial data with Basic Financials From Finnhub tool.
      - Obtain the {company}'s financial statement with Financial Statements From Polygon tool.
      - Obtain the WACC value with WACC Calculator tool. (Use correct input parameter which is calculated from the former data)
    After obtaning data, using the former data, use Expectations Investing tool with the data.(Use correct input parameter which is calculated from the former data)
    You can also use both WebsiteSearchTool and scrape website tool to get the data from web.(Do not try to read the pdf content from website with scrape website tool as it can exceed maximun token limit)

    IMPORTANT
    - Before using the WACC Calculator and Expectations Investing tool, use other provided tool to get enough data.
    - When performing calculations, all monetary amounts must be converted to dollars before computation. For example, '50 million dollars' should be input as 50000000, and '4b dollars' should be input as 4000000000.
    - Use recent data from financial statements. If the latest financial data is unavailable, you can use the previous year's data for the calculation(and specify the reason).
    - Do not judge the result of Expectations Investing tool(it can be SELL, BUY or HOLD), only judge whether the parameters of the tool used in the calculation are accurate.

  expected_output: >
    The result of the Expectations Investing.

    [Must Contains]
    - Key matrics of result which is given by Expectations Investing tool.
    - Explain the source of the input data.
    - [VERY IMPORTANT] Explain the accuracy of calculated input paramter.
    - [VERY IMPORTANT] Ensure to specify the reliability of the result data.
    
    [OUTPUT FORMAT]
    The final report MUST use Markdown format for optimal readability.

2915509260,2353,[BUG] ImportError: cannot import name 'LLM' from 'crewai',drobbins-ancile,31445210,closed,2025-03-13T01:00:37Z,2025-03-13T12:38:05Z,https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI,https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/2353,"### Description

I am attempting to use AWS Bedrock as my model provider and following the docs as seen here: https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/llms#aws-bedrock

When starting my app I get an import error:

`ImportError: cannot import name 'LLM' from 'crewai'`

Are the docs incorrect? If so, is there a preferred method to use AWS Bedrock as a model provider?

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Import LLM from crewai
2. Create an LLM config:

```
bedrock_llm = LLM(
    model=""bedrock/anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0""
)
```

3. Create an agent that uses the LLM

```
    test_agent = Agent(
        role=""test agentr"",
        goal=""To test"",
        verbose=True,
        backstory=""A test"",
		llm=bedrock_llm
    )
```

4. Launch the app and get an error:

`ImportError: cannot import name 'LLM' from 'crewai'`

### Expected behavior

The LLM class is imported successfully and the app runs.

2923707856,2385,[FEATURE] Implement set_knowledge Method in BaseAgent to Enable Knowledge Integration​,Programmer-RD-AI,79456372,closed,2025-03-17T04:25:20Z,2025-03-17T09:01:41Z,https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI,https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/2385,"### Feature Area

Core functionality

### Is your feature request related to a an existing bug? Please link it here.

NA

### Describe the solution you'd like

In CrewAI, the `BaseAgent` class currently includes a `set_knowledge` method that is not implemented:


```python
def set_knowledge(self, crew_embedder: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None):
    pass
```

Implementing this method is essential for agents to utilize external knowledge sources effectively. The implementation should allow agents to access various data types, such as:

- Text files
- PDFs
- CSV files
- JSON files
- Web pages
- YouTube videos
- Documentation websites

By enabling agents to incorporate these knowledge sources, we can enhance their ability to provide informed and contextually relevant responses. This aligns with CrewAI's goal of creating intelligent agents capable of accessing and utilizing external information during their tasks.


### Describe alternatives you've considered


An alternative approach could involve creating specialized agent subclasses with their own methods for handling knowledge integration. However, this would lead to code redundancy and inconsistency across different agents. Implementing the `set_knowledge` method within the `BaseAgent` class ensures a standardized and scalable solution for knowledge integration across all agents.


### Additional context


Implementing the `set_knowledge` method would also facilitate the use of CrewAI's Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Tool, which allows agents to query dynamic knowledge bases for relevant information. This tool supports various data sources, including PDFs, CSVs, JSON files, web pages, and more, enabling agents to provide contextually accurate responses. citeturn0search2

Follow up on #1629 as it was not addressed. It looks like when `Crew.kickoff_for_each()` is called for a crew that contains ConditionalTask items, the copied crews cast the ConditionalTask as a Task instead. As a result conditional task crews are broken when running with `kickoff_for_each()`.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Create a crew with a conditional task
2. Run `crew.kickoff_for_each(inputs=[...])`
3. See that conditional tasks are always run and can be debugged to return `type=Task`, not `type=ConditionalTask`

### Expected behavior

ConditionalTask items should be copied as ConditionalTasks, not Tasks.

The documentation shows this import statement under [Example: Use Custom Memory Instances e.g FAISS as the VectorDB](https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/memory#example%3A-use-custom-memory-instances-e-g-faiss-as-the-vectordb):

`from crewai.memory.storage import LTMSQLiteStorage, RAGStorage`

Which is incorrect and results in an import error.

Looking at [the storage code](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/tree/main/src/crewai/memory/storage), the correct imports should be:

```
from crewai.memory.storage.rag_storage import RAGStorage
from crewai.memory.storage.ltm_sqlite_storage.py import LTMSQLiteStorage

The CrewAI framework throws an AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'replace' when attempting to execute a Crew with an Agent configured with only the system_template parameter, while the prompt_template is left undefined (i.e., None).
And ,if prompt_template proveded also,but response_template not provided,error occurred also!

### Steps to Reproduce

simple example 

### Expected behavior

no error,if these three parameters are optional

### Screenshots/Code snippets

from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew

# Incorrect Agent configuration (missing prompt_template)
designer = Agent(

### Is your feature request related to a an existing bug? Please link it here.

Is there a way we can run a same crew multiple times parallelly on different inputs? Like I was trying to run crewai with Threadpool but the output keeps getting stuck at the last row, which is increasing the latency otherwise it's not that high. There is no documentation if this is currently mentioned somewhere. Like I want to kickoff the crew 100k times which would require parallel processing.

### Describe the solution you'd like

A solution would be a compatible method inside crew's library like kickoff for each but which runs parallely taking the number of threads as a variable too along with the dataset.

Hi,

I am trying to install crewai, crewai_tools with the zenml[server]. I am facing a dependency conflict in which crewai latest version depends on Click version >=8.1.7, whereas zenml depends on click version ""^8.0.1,<8.1.4"".

Can you please help on resolving the issue. I have pasted my pyproject.toml file below

```toml

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Install poetry
2. Create a empty project directory
3. Then create a empty pyproject.toml file and paste the above into that file
4. Run below command to install the dependencies
```cmd
poetry install
```

### Expected behavior

Every dependency/library should install

Thus, zenml[server] (>=0.75.1,<0.76.0) is incompatible with crewai (>=0.95.0,<0.105.0).
So, because bussinessreportanalysisagent depends on both crewai (>=0.95.0,<0.105.0) and zenml[server] (>=0.75.1,<0.76.0), version solving failed.

Describe the solution you'd like
I think it should be possible to override _ask_human_input function. Sometimes, the user would like to get input from other source than the CLI.

Currently, to get human feedback, it is executed:

    def _ask_human_input(self, final_answer: str) -> str:
        """"""Prompt human input for final decision making.""""""
        self._printer.print(
            content=f""\033[1m\033[95m ## Final Result:\033[00m \033[92m{final_answer}\033[00m""
        )

        self._printer.print(
            content=(
                ""\n\n=====\n""
                ""## Please provide feedback on the Final Result and the Agent's actions. ""
                ""Respond with 'looks good' or a similar phrase when you're satisfied.\n""
                ""=====\n""
            ),
            color=""bold_yellow"",
        )
        return input()
Look that the human input in gotten from input() function



### Describe the solution you'd like

Let the user set an option on the Task to override the function, such as:

I’m looking to integrate Redis history into CrewAI to manage conversation history more efficiently. The idea is to use Redis for storing and retrieving past interactions, which would help improve context handling and scalability for Crew. But i found, there is no direct support for Redis with Crew.

I tried exploring [mem0](https://github.com/mem0ai/mem0) which uses Redis as a VectorDB support.

Currently there is hardcoded mem0 integration which uses API KEY,  Find it here: [mem0_storage.py](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/blob/fe0813e831bf930146b7ad12356eaecfcf600b49/src/crewai/memory/storage/mem0_storage.py#L37)

### Describe the solution you'd like

It should be something like:
```
# Define configuration for Mem0 memory with Redis as the vector store
mem0_redis_config = {
    ""vector_store"": {
        ""provider"": ""redis"",
        ""config"": {
            ""collection_name"": ""collection_mem0"",

        }
    },
    ""version"": ""v1.1""
}

# Initialize Memory instance
mem0_instance = Memory.from_config(mem0_redis_config)
```

I see there’s [llama_deploy](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_deploy/tree/main/examples/quick_start) for workflows built on Langchain ecosystem. Although it may be used for deploying the workflows built on crewai, but I don’t find examples or documentations.

There are [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGID_du9-So) talking about deploying workflows built on crewai using docker. But it requires some extra work writing Dockerfile, building the image and deploy container. Is there a straight-forward tool for deploying the crewai workflow?

Provide a tool similar to llama_deploy but catering to crewai.

Or provide documentation about how to use 3rd tools to deploy crewai workflows.

## Feature Request: Include Tool Results in ToolUsageFinishedEvent

### Current Behavior
Currently, when a tool execution is completed, CrewAI emits a `ToolUsageFinishedEvent` that includes various metadata about the execution (agent info, tool name, arguments, timing, etc.) but doesn't include the actual result returned by the tool. 

This means that event listeners need to implement complex workarounds to access the tool results, typically by accessing the agent's `tools_results` array and searching for matching entries.

### Proposed Change
Add a `result` field to the `ToolUsageFinishedEvent` class and ensure it's populated with the tool's execution result when the event is emitted.

### Benefits
1. Improved developer experience when working with tool execution events
2. Reduced coupling between event listeners and CrewAI's internal structure
3. More complete event information - events should contain all relevant data
4. Simplifies external integrations and monitoring systems that rely on events

### Implementation
The change would be minimal and backward compatible:

1. Modify the `ToolUsageFinishedEvent` class in `crewai/utilities/events/tool_usage_events.py`:
```python
class ToolUsageFinishedEvent(ToolUsageEvent):
    """"""Event emitted when a tool execution is completed""""""
    started_at: datetime
    finished_at: datetime
    from_cache: bool = False
    result: Any = None  # Add this field
    type: str = ""tool_usage_finished""
```

Add the tool execution result directly to ToolUsageFinishedEvent:

1. Add a `result: Any = None` field to the ToolUsageFinishedEvent class

2. Modify the ToolUsage.on_tool_use_finished method to include the result in the event data:
   - Update the method signature to accept the result parameter
   - Add the result to the event_data dictionary

3. Update the call to on_tool_use_finished in the _use method to pass the result parameter

This would allow event listeners to directly access the tool's result output through event.result without having to implement complex workarounds.

Current workarounds and alternatives I've explored:

1. Current workaround: Access agent.tools_results from the event's source
   - Requires searching through a list of results to find the matching entry
   - Creates tight coupling between listeners and CrewAI's internal structure
   - Brittle if CrewAI changes how tool results are stored

2. Alternative: Create a custom subclass of ToolUsageFinishedEvent
   - Would require monkey-patching the event bus to intercept events
   - Complexity of maintaining this external to CrewAI codebase
   - Risk of breaking when CrewAI is updated

3. Alternative: Add a tool results caching system to event listeners
   - Additional complexity and state management
   - Would still need to correlate events with cached results

   - **Solar Roof:** A newer product that integrates solar cells into roof tiles, providing both roofing and energy generation.
   - **Energy Storage:** Battery products including the Powerwall for homes, Powerpack for businesses, and Megapack for utility customers, designed to store renewable energy and enhance grid stability.

3. **Services and Other Revenue:** Tesla generates additional revenue through vehicle servicing, merchandise sales, and regulatory credit sales. The company sells regulatory credits to other automakers who need to comply with emissions standards.

4. **Software Services:** Notably, Tesla differentiates itself with its software and technology offerings, including:
   - **Full Self-Driving (FSD) Capability:** An advanced driver-assistance package that enhances vehicle capabilities and enables features like Navigate on Autopilot, Summon, and AutoPark.
   - **Over-the-air (OTA) Updates:** Routine software updates that improve features and performance without requiring physical dealership visits.

**Market Presence:**
Tesla operates in multiple markets globally, with a strong presence in North America, Europe, and Asia. The company is known for its innovative marketing, focusing less on traditional advertising and more on building a strong brand through community engagement and word-of-mouth. In 2023, Tesla is noted as the leading manufacturer in the electric vehicle space, having sold over 1 million units globally in the previous fiscal year.

Tesla has continually pushed the envelope with its Gigafactories, which are massive manufacturing facilities aimed at producing batteries and electric vehicles at scale, especially Gigafactory Berlin in Germany and Gigafactory Shanghai in China. These factories enhance Tesla's capacity to meet demand and optimize production efficiency.

Additionally, Tesla has established a Supercharger network, which enables long-distance travel for EV users by offering fast battery charging stations globally.

In conclusion, Tesla’s operations are characterized by its commitment to sustainable technology through electric vehicles and energy products, bolstered by innovative business practices and significant global market engagement. With continuous advancements in technology and strategic expansions, Tesla aims to maintain its lead in the burgeoning electric vehicle market.I now can give a great answer.

I encountered an issue when using CrewAI with Mem0 as the memory provider and Google Gemini 2.0 as the LLM The error occurs in ContextualMemory when trying to fetch user memory.

I tried the code with 

client = MemoryClient()

and 

client = MemoryClient(
    api_key=""api key directly"",
    org_id=""my org id"",
    project_id=""my proj id""
)


### Steps to Reproduce

Install crewai and mem0ai using: pip install crewai mem0ai

import os
from crewai import Crew, Process
from mem0 import MemoryClient
os.environ[""MEM0_API_KEY""] = userdata.get('MEM0_API_KEY')
client = MemoryClient()
messages = [
    {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""Hi there! I'm planning a vacation and could use some advice.""},
     {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""Hello! I'd be happy to help with your vacation planning. What kind of destination do you prefer?""},
     {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""I am more of a beach person than a mountain person.""},
     {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""That's interesting. Do you like hotels or Airbnb?""},
     {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""I like Airbnb more.""},
 ]
 client.add(messages, user_id=""john"")

agent = Agent(
    role=""About User"",
    goal=""You know everything about the user."",
    backstory=""""""You are a master at understanding people and their preferences."""""",
    verbose=True,
    allow_delegation=False,
    llm=llm1, #the llm1 is saved in the os.environ
)
task = Task(
    description=""Answer the following questions about the user: {question}"",
    expected_output=""An answer to the question."",
    agent=agent,
)

crew = Crew(
    agents=[agent],
    tasks=[task],
    process = Process.sequential,
    verbose=True,
    memory=True,
    memory_config={
        ""provider"": ""mem0"",
        ""config"": {""user_id"": ""john""},
    },
)

crew.kickoff(inputs={""question"": ""What is your favorite vacation destination?""})

### Expected behavior

Expected Behavior:
The CrewAI agent should retrieve user memory from Mem0.

Actual Behavior:

2946618302,2464,[BUG] CrewAI ChromaDB Embedding Dimension Mismatch Issue,amdjedbens,44640851,closed,2025-03-25T13:50:34Z,2025-06-03T12:17:21Z,https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI,https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/2464,"### Description

When using CrewAI with knowledge sources, I'm encountering an embedding dimension mismatch error if I've previously used a different embedding model in the same project. This appears to happen because CrewAI uses ChromaDB as its default vector database, and ChromaDB enforces consistent embedding dimensions across operations.

```
[ERROR]: Embedding dimension mismatch. This usually happens when mixing different embedding models.
Try resetting the collection using `crewai reset-memories -a`

ValueError: Invalid Knowledge Configuration: Embedding dimension mismatch. Make sure you're using the same embedding model across all operations with this collection.
Try resetting the collection using `crewai reset-memories -a`
```

The issue shows up as a dimension mismatch error (e.g., 768 vs 1536) between current embeddings and previously stored embeddings.


### Steps to Reproduce

1. Create a CrewAI project with agents that use knowledge sources
2. Run the project with one embedding model (e.g., OpenAI's model with 1536 dimensions)
3. Change the embedding model to a different one (e.g., Ollama's nomic-embed-text with 768 dimensions)
4. Run the project again without clearing previous embeddings


### Expected behavior

The project should either:
- Detect the embedding model change and automatically reset collections
- Convert embeddings to be compatible
- Provide a clearer error message with automated recovery

## Current Behavior

The project fails with a cryptic ChromaDB error about dimension mismatch that is confusing since there's no clear indication that CrewAI is using ChromaDB under the hood.

I've tried running the suggested command `crewai reset-memories -a` but didn't work as well

## Help Needed

Has anyone encountered this issue and found a reliable solution? I need a way to either:
1. Properly reset the ChromaDB collections
2. Configure CrewAI to use a different vector database
3. Ensure consistent embedding dimensions across runs

# [BUG] Multimodal Agent Validation Errors with Image Processing

## Description
When implementing a multimodal agent using CrewAI for image analysis, such as [this example](https://docs.crewai.com/how-to/multimodal-agents#using-multimodal-agents) the system encounters validation errors during message processing. The errors appear to be related to Pydantic's message validation when attempting to process image content through the LLM.

2. Create and run the following script:

```python
#minimal.py
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew, LLM
import os

# Configure API keys
OPENAI_API_KEY = os.getenv(""OPENAI_API_KEY"")
if not OPENAI_API_KEY:
    raise ValueError(""Please set OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable"")

# Initialize LLM
llm = LLM(
    model=""openai/gpt-4o"", # model with vision capabilities
    api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY,
    temperature=0.7
)


# Create an agent with multimodal capabilities
expert_analyst = Agent(

### Expected behavior

The multimodal agent should:
1. Successfully fetch the image from the provided URL
2. Process the image using the configured LLM
3. Generate a detailed analysis report based on the image content
4. Handle the multimodal content without validation errors

Also tried `gemini/gemini-2.0-flash` which also has vision capabilities

2961438345,2503,[BUG] max_execution_time doesn't work,dogadogan,11411924,closed,2025-03-31T19:54:39Z,2025-03-31T21:46:18Z,https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI,https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/2503,"### Description

First off, I want to say that CrewAI is an incredible framework — I've really enjoyed exploring it and truly appreciate all the work that has gone into building it!
 
I wanted to reach out regarding an issue with the `max_execution_time` agent attribute, which defines the maximum time for task execution. The problem arises when an LLM request times out, causing the agentic workflow to get stuck without a way for CrewAI to recover. It looks like multiple users have reported experiencing the same issue:

1. https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/2379
2. https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/1380
3. https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/1996

**I also noticed that there are a few open pull requests that appear to address this issue:**

1. https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2388
2. https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2024
3. https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2380

 
Would you and your team be able to review and potentially kindly merge one of these? This would be tremendously helpful for myself and others who have encountered this challenge!
 
I really appreciate your time and consideration! 😊
 
 
Kind regards,
Doga

### Steps to Reproduce

In workflows using OpenAI/Azure, if there is an issue with the server connection every once in a while, and it times out, setting the `max_execution_time` parameter doesn't make any difference in detecting and recovering the timeout.

### Expected behavior

The system should stop waiting for a response after the time defined by `max_execution_time`, and re-execute the query.

### Describe the solution you'd like

Yesterday, during a live demo by @vladeziegler on [AI Agent Week—Portugal](https://lu.ma/lisbonagentweek?tk=GqGTK6), I realized that he had the same problem as I had multiple times. 

The idea is that we have an Agent with a `role`, `goal`, and `backstory`. The agent also has `tools` that are semantically correct to assign to it.

The problem is that you often want to instruct agents on how to use some tools. But semantically, it is not clear where to do that. Usually your best options are task description itself of backstory. 

The task option does not sound very good since tasks are detached from agents. The backstory also looks semantically incorrect since it must be some story about an agent and not a specific tool.

So I propose to create an additional level of abstractions to make things look better:

```python
from crew import ToolWithInstruction
from crewai_tools import ScrapeWebsiteTool

tool_with_instruction = ToolWithInstruction(
  ScrapeWebsiteTool(),
  """"""
  ALWAYS use this tool when making a joke.
  NEVER use this tool when making joke about someones mom.
  """"""
)

agent = Agent(
           role=""Comedian"",
           goal=""Create hilarious and engaging jokes"",
           backstory=""""""
                 You are a professional stand-up comedian with years of experience in crafting jokes.
                  You have a great sense of humor and can create jokes about any topic while keeping them appropriate and entertaining.
           """""",
            tools=[tool_with_instruction],
        )
```

So now we will somehow include these instructions when prompting LLM with tool and from framework it looks consistent. 

### Describe alternatives you've considered

They way i am doing it right now is:

```python
from crewai_tools import ScrapeWebsiteTool

agent = Agent(
           role=""Comedian"",
           goal=""Create hilarious and engaging jokes"",
           backstory=""""""
                 You are a professional stand-up comedian with years of experience in crafting jokes.
                 You have a great sense of humor and can create jokes about any topic while keeping them appropriate and entertaining.
                 ALWAYS use ScrapeWebsiteTool tool when making a joke.
                 NEVER use ScrapeWebsiteTool when making joke about someones mom.
           """""",
            tools=[ScrapeWebsiteTool()],
        )
```

It does a job, but it always feels a bit wrong to put such things in the backstory. With multiple tools assigned it also looks messy.

No `pyproject.toml` found in current directory or any parent directory
An error occurred while running the crew: Command '['uv', 'sync']' returned non-zero exit status 2.

My python environment version is Python 3.11.7

My pyproject.toml is

[project]
name = ""knifeqa""
version = ""0.1.0""
description = ""knifeqa using crewAI""
authors = [{ name = ""Your Name"", email = ""you@example.com"" }]
requires-python = "">=3.10,<3.13""
dependencies = [
    ""crewai[tools]>=0.108.0,<1.0.0"",

test = ""knifeqa.main:test""

[build-system]
requires = [""hatchling""]
build-backend = ""hatchling.build""

[tool.crewai]

### Steps to Reproduce

1. python -m venv .venv
2. !pip install crewai uv langtrace-python-sdk
3. crewai create crew ""name of the project""
4. crewai install --> this is when the error occurred
5. Couldnt also run crewai run because of the install

### Expected behavior

Intall all of crewai needed libraries and then run ""run"" to kick of the crewai test sample

2978139649,2532,[FEATURE] Add Context/Prompt Caching Support,imperorrp,24991131,closed,2025-04-07T22:32:59Z,2025-04-18T00:06:25Z,https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI,https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/2532,"### Feature Area

Performance optimization

### Is your feature request related to a an existing bug? Please link it here.

N/A

### Describe the solution you'd like

Adding partial context/prompt caching support could be a useful cost lowering and speed enhancing addition to CrewAI for models and model providers that support this. There currently seems to be an internal kind of caching of repeat tool calls in CrewAI as far as I could see, but not for prompt token caching itself.

This could be very useful for flows or crews where multiple tool calls have to be made with parts of the prompt having lengthy and mostly unchanging context. 

OpenAI and Deepseek models have prompt caching enabled automatically but Anthropic and Gemini require explicit instructions on what to cache and, in Gemini's case, how long (TTL).

LiteLLM has some support for context/prompt caching that CrewAI could also make use of for calls made through it (basically adding a `cache_control` parameter to calls made)

https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/completion/prompt_caching 
https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers/anthropic#prompt-caching 
https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers/gemini#context-caching 

(Using Gemini context caching with LiteLLM is currently in the style of Anthropic's prompt caching method, so Gemini's custom TTL defining feature for caches is not useable right now via LiteLLM)

Some thoughts concerning implementation logic:
- One approach could be enabling caching of a system prompt for an agent as a whole (for example a book or PDF) that an agent is supposed to be an expert on and is going to be invoked multiple times in a short duration. 
- Another could be caching task-specific material- perhaps letting crews/agents themselves decide if something should be cached? (this definitely needs to be thought out more)

2978827858,2536,[BUG] Cannot disable CrewAI telemetry without disabling OpenTelemetry globally,ronensc,37826670,closed,2025-04-08T07:10:53Z,2025-04-09T17:20:35Z,https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI,https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/2536,"### Description

CrewAI currently enables its own telemetry by default. According to the [docs](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/blob/d7fa8464c70584452c42531d60106753e49aef18/docs/telemetry.mdx?plain=1#L25), the way to disable telemetry is by setting the `OTEL_SDK_DISABLED` environment variable to true.

However, per the [OpenTelemetry Python documentation](https://opentelemetry-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sdk/environment_variables.html#opentelemetry.sdk.environment_variables.OTEL_SDK_DISABLED), this disables the SDK for all signals, which affects user-defined or third-party OpenTelemetry instrumentation as well.

This makes it difficult to integrate CrewAI into observability-aware environments where developers want to control telemetry more selectively.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Set up an app that uses CrewAI and also manually configures OpenTelemetry (e.g., with a custom tracer provider).

2. Attempt to disable only CrewAI’s telemetry via `OTEL_SDK_DISABLED=true`.

3. Observe that all telemetry is disabled — including user-defined spans.

### Expected behavior

A way to disable only CrewAI’s internal telemetry without disabling OpenTelemetry entirely. Ideally via an env var like:

```
CREWAI_DISABLE_TELEMETRY=true
```

2981064558,2539,[FEATURE] No Errors in Pyright for Example Code,ChiefMateStarbuck,23060145,closed,2025-04-08T22:18:42Z,2025-05-15T12:17:15Z,https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI,https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/2539,"
The example `crew.py` has multiple errors when using pyright LSP. The errors are listed below


1. 
``` py
    def researcher(self) -> Agent: 
        return Agent(
            config=self.agents_config['researcher'], 
            verbose=True
        )
```
```
Arguments missing for parameters ""role"", ""goal"", ""backstory""
```

```
Argument of type ""Literal['researcher']"" cannot be assigned to parameter ""key"" of type ""SupportsIndex | slice[Any, Any, Any]"" in function ""__getitem__""
  Type ""Literal['researcher']"" is not assignable to type ""SupportsIndex | slice[Any, Any, Any]""
    ""Literal['researcher']"" is incompatible with protocol ""SupportsIndex""
      ""__index__"" is not present
    ""Literal['researcher']"" is not assignable to ""slice[Any, Any, Any]""
```

The first is error is that the `config=self.agents_config['researcher'],` line is not properly informing pyright of the fact that these parameters are set within the yaml file. I am uncertain of what a solution would look like. 

The second error is beyond my python knowledge.

Both of these errors are also prevalent in the `Task()` initializer function.



2.

``` py
        return Crew(
            agents=self.agents, # Automatically created by the @agent decorator
            tasks=self.tasks, # Automatically created by the @task decorator
            process=Process.sequential,
            verbose=True,
            # process=Process.hierarchical, # In case you wanna use that instead https://docs.crewai.com/how-to/Hierarchical/
        )
```

```
Cannot access attribute ""agents"" for class ""LogCrews*""
  Attribute ""agents"" is unknown
```

The error is that self.agent doesn't exists until `@agent` decorator creates them.

I am uncertain of how to solve these problems, but given guidance, I am willing to take this on task. LMK

ImportError: cannot import name 'Self' from 'typing' (/home/paperspace/anaconda3/envs/doc_env/lib/python3.10/typing.py)
An error occurred while running the crew: Command '['uv', 'run', 'run_crew']' returned non-zero exit status 1.

### Possible Solution

May be due to python version not supporting the crew version 

### Additional context

In crewai/memory/memory.py
```
from typing import Any, Dict, List, Optional,Self
```
Self is found but in my python 3.10.12 site packages,in typing i couldnt see Self but Any,Dict,List,Optional are there.but in your crew [doumentation](https://docs.crewai.com/installation) mentions python 3.10 is supported.I have tried out with python 3.11.7 but worked.

2986177333,2574,Issue with CodeInterpreterTool not executing code (Agent responds but does nothing),diegoo7am,130773547,closed,2025-04-10T16:07:04Z,2025-04-17T12:18:27Z,https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI,https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/2574,"### Description

I am building a full machine learning pipeline using CrewAI, and one of the agents is supposed to execute preprocessing steps via the CodeInterpreterTool. However, the Feature Engineering Specialist agent does not execute any code and finishes the task with a general response, ignoring the prompt instructions.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Set up a CodeInterpreterTool like this:

code_tool = CodeInterpreterTool(
    user_dockerfile_path='path_to_dockerfile'
)
2. Define a feature_engineering_agent and assign it the code_tool as its only tool:
feature_engineering_agent = Agent(
    role='Feature Engineering Specialist',
    goal='Clean, encode, and split raw data for machine learning using reproducible code and best practices.',
    backstory='A meticulous data engineer who transforms raw datasets into modeling-ready splits.',
    tools=[code_tool],
    verbose=True
)

3. Create a Task instructing the agent:
feature_engineering_task = Task(
    description=(
        ""You are responsible for cleaning and preparing the dataset `{dataset}` for modeling. Your steps are:\n\n""
        ""1. Load the CSV file.\n""
        ""2. Handle missing values (mean/mode or drop rows).\n""
        ""3. Encode categorical variables (OneHot or Ordinal).\n""
        ""4. Split the data using train_test_split with stratification on `{target_variable}` (80/20).\n""
        ""5. Apply SMOTE (on training set only) if necessary.\n""
        ""6. Save these outputs:\n""
        ""- X_train.csv\n- X_test.csv\n- y_train.csv\n- y_test.csv\n\n""
        ""👉 YOU MUST USE the Code Interpreter Tool to actually run your code.\n\n""
        ""Use the following exact syntax:\n""
        ""```python\n""
        ""code_tool.run(\n""
        ""    code=\""\""\""\n""
        ""# your Python code here\n""
        ""    \""\""\"",\n""
        ""    libraries_used=['pandas', 'numpy', 'scikit-learn', 'imblearn']\n""
        "")\n""
        ""```\n\n""
        ""✅ Your final answer MUST be the **output of the tool**.\n""
        ""❌ Do NOT just summarize what you did. Actually call the tool.""
    ),
    expected_output=""The result from the CodeInterpreterTool confirming files were saved."",
    agent=feature_engineering_agent
)

4. Run the Crew with process=Process.sequential and memory=True.

5. Observe the output of the feature engineering task.

### Expected behavior

I expected the agent to generate and execute Python code using the tool as defined in its task. The code should clean the dataset and save outputs like X_train.csv, etc.

### Screenshots/Code snippets

None

### Operating System

Windows 11

### Python Version

3.10

### crewAI Version

0.108.0

### crewAI Tools Version

0.38.1

### Virtual Environment

Venv

### Evidence

# Agent: Feature Engineering Specialist
## Final Answer: 
My best complete final answer to the task is as follows:

To clean and prepare the dataset `./upsell_train_corrected.csv` for modeling, I will perform the following steps:

1. Load the CSV file.
2. Handle missing values by imputing the mean for numeric columns (income and engagement_score).
3. Encode categorical variables using OneHot encoding.
4. Split the data using train_test_split with stratification on the `upsell` column with an 80/20 ratio.
5. Save the resulting datasets as X_train.csv, X_test.csv, y_train.csv, and y_test.csv.

Let's proceed with these steps to prepare the dataset for modeling.

### Possible Solution

I thought it could be some issue with memory, cache, or hallucination, but I am a beginner.

### Additional context

Other agents that use CodeInterpreterTool work fine and in previous executions it runs well. Sometimes also happened with another agent that use a custom tool."

### Possible Solution

You could either drop support for Python 3.10 or update the typing import to be compatible with Python 3.10. In either way, the latest release should probably be yanked to avoid Python 3.10 users getting a broken version of crewai.

Agent capabilities

### Is your feature request related to a an existing bug? Please link it here.

No

### Describe the solution you'd like

Currently, agents share a ​​global memory space​​ without isolation. This makes it impossible to:

- Scope memories to specific entities (e.g., users, accounts, sessions).
- Retrieve memories contextually (e.g., fetch only memories tied to account_id=123).
- Prevent accidental data leakage across logical boundaries.

Which will have the following Benefits

✅ ​​Multi-tenancy​​: Isolate memories per user/account/context.
✅ ​​Contextual Recall​​: Agents fetch only relevant memories.

The issue is in crewai.crew.py

On line 1215 the crew modeled is copied:
copied_data = self.model_dump(exclude=exclude)

The issue is this is serializing the memory models to dicts, which then causes the copied crew pydantic validation to fail.

I was able to fix this by adding:
copied_data[""short_term_memory""] = self.short_term_memory.model_copy() if self.short_term_memory else None
        copied_data[""long_term_memory""] = self.long_term_memory.model_copy() if self.long_term_memory else None
        copied_data[""entity_memory""] = self.entity_memory.model_copy() if self.entity_memory else None

I am sure you can also specify rules or settings in pydantic to handle the serialization

When using CrewAI's hierarchical process with delegation, the manager agent fails to delegate tasks due to type validation errors in the DelegateWorkToolSchema. The manager attempts to pass dictionary objects for task and context parameters, but the schema expects string values.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Create a basic hierarchical crew with a manager agent and worker agents
3. Enable delegation for the manager (allow_delegation=True)
4. Set up the process as hierarchical (process=Process.hierarchical)
5. Run the crew

```

### Possible Solution

# Analysis of the CrewAI Delegation Error and Proposed Solution

After analyzing the CrewAI codebase thoroughly, I can identify the exact cause of the delegation error and suggest an appropriate fix that the repository owners would likely appreciate.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue occurs in the hierarchical process when the manager agent attempts to delegate tasks. Here's what's happening:

1. The `DelegateWorkToolSchema` (in `delegate_work_tool.py`) is defined with string fields:
   ```python
   class DelegateWorkToolSchema(BaseModel):
       task: str = Field(..., description=""The task to delegate"")
       context: str = Field(..., description=""The context for the task"")
       coworker: str = Field(..., description=""The role/name of the coworker to delegate to"")
   ```

2. However, when the manager agent tries to delegate, it's passing Task objects or dictionaries with a format like:
   ```python
   {'description': 'Research...thcare.', 'type': 'str'}
   ```

3. The validation fails because the schema expects strings, not dictionaries.

## Most Likely Solution

The best solution would be to modify the `DelegateWorkToolSchema` class to accept both string and dictionary inputs, ensuring backward compatibility while fixing the issue:

```python
from typing import Optional, Union, Dict, Any
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class DelegateWorkToolSchema(BaseModel):
    task: Union[str, Dict[str, Any]] = Field(..., description=""The task to delegate"")
    context: Union[str, Dict[str, Any]] = Field(..., description=""The context for the task"")
    coworker: str = Field(..., description=""The role/name of the coworker to delegate to"")
```

Then, modify the `DelegateWorkTool._run` method to handle both formats:

```python
def _run(
    self,
    task: Union[str, Dict[str, Any]],
    context: Union[str, Dict[str, Any]],
    coworker: Optional[str] = None,
    **kwargs,
) -> str:
    # Convert task to string if it's a dictionary
    if isinstance(task, dict) and ""description"" in task:
        task = task[""description""]
    
    # Convert context to string if it's a dictionary
    if isinstance(context, dict) and ""description"" in context:
        context = context[""description""]
        
    coworker = self._get_coworker(coworker, **kwargs)
    return self._execute(coworker, task, context)
```

## Why This Solution Works

1. **Backward Compatibility**: This solution maintains compatibility with existing code that passes strings.

2. **Enhanced Flexibility**: It allows for both string and dictionary inputs, making the API more flexible.

3. **Minimal Changes**: The fix is localized to just the delegation tool schema and its implementation.

4. **Matches Workflow Intent**: It maintains the original intent of the delegation workflow while fixing the type mismatch.

This approach is also aligned with how CrewAI handles other tool validations in the codebase, as seen in the `tool_usage.py` file where there are several input validation and conversion mechanisms.

## Alternative Solution (If Type Changes Are Undesirable)

If changing the schema types is problematic, an alternative would be to add pre-processing in the `Agent.get_delegation_tools` method to ensure tasks are converted to strings before being passed to the delegation tool:

```python
def get_delegation_tools(self, agents: List[BaseAgent]):
    # Create a custom wrapper that pre-processes arguments
    agent_tools = AgentTools(agents=agents, preprocess_task_to_string=True)
    tools = agent_tools.tools()
    return tools
```

When I use multithreading or asyncio to make requests concurrently, I eventually get a ""Segmentation fault (core dumped)"" error. There aren’t any other logs — it just crashes. It usually happens after the different crews have been running in parallel for a while. The same problem for two approaches. Tried with 5+ threads / semaphores.

I'm using Python 3.10, 32 GB of RAM. For the LLM, I’m connecting to a private API where the model is hosted by vLLM.

### Steps to Reproduce

use concurrency in Python for the Crew

no crash + appropriate logging of errors / warnings if possible

3006627271,2645,"[BUG] CrewAI Incorrectly Prepends ""models/"" Prefix to Gemini Model ID When Using Explicit ChatGoogleGenerativeAI LLM",spectrefelsip,23175221,closed,2025-04-19T19:49:12Z,2025-05-26T12:17:16Z,https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI,https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/2645,"### Description

When using CrewAI with a Google Gemini model by explicitly specifying the LLM via a ChatGoogleGenerativeAI object (from langchain-google-genai), CrewAI incorrectly modifies the model identifier before passing it to LiteLLM.

Specifically, if ChatGoogleGenerativeAI is initialized with model=""gemini/model-name"", during task execution (crew.kickoff()), CrewAI appears to transform this identifier into model=""models/gemini/model-name"".

This causes the call to litellm.completion to fail, as LiteLLM's get_llm_provider function does not recognize the models/provider/model format and raises a litellm.exceptions.BadRequestError: LLM Provider NOT provided.

It has been verified via a direct LiteLLM test that the call works perfectly if the gemini/model-name identifier and the correct API key are used, isolating the issue to the interaction within CrewAI when the explicit LLM is used.

### Steps to Reproduce

Setup Environment:

    Create a Python virtual environment.

    Install required dependencies: pip install crewai langchain-google-genai google-generativeai litellm python-dotenv (see pip freeze below for exact versions).

Set Environment Variables:

    In the terminal, export the API Keys:

          
    export GOOGLE_API_KEY='YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY'
    export GEMINI_API_KEY='YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY' # Use the same key as GOOGLE_API_KEY
    # IMPORTANT: Do NOT set OPENAI_MODEL_NAME for this reproduction!
    unset OPENAI_MODEL_NAME
    unset OPENAI_API_BASE

Create Python Script (repro_crewai_bug.py):

 ```     
import os

from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew, Process
from langchain_google_genai import ChatGoogleGenerativeAI
# from dotenv import load_dotenv # Uncomment if using .env

-----------------</pre>

### Possible Solution

The only method that seems to work reliably is not passing an explicit llm object to the Agent and instead, configuring CrewAI to infer the LLM via the following environment variables:

      
export GOOGLE_API_KEY='YOUR_API_KEY'
export GEMINI_API_KEY='YOUR_API_KEY'
export OPENAI_MODEL_NAME='gemini/gemini-2.0-flash' # Or the desired model
export OPENAI_API_BASE='https://api.example.com/v1' # To prevent attempts via OpenAI

With this environment variable configuration, the execution succeeds.

3006694612,2647,[BUG] Authentication Error When Using OpenAI Compatible LLMs - Generic error message,carvalhomm,56235172,closed,2025-04-19T22:56:36Z,2025-06-09T14:17:06Z,https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI,https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/2647,"### Description

When configuring CrewAI to use an OpenAI-compatible LLM provider (not OpenAI itself), the framework incorrectly attempts to validate API keys against OpenAI's authentication servers regardless of the specified base_url. This results in authentication failures with error code 401 even when valid credentials for the alternative provider are supplied.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Install the required dependencies:

langchain==0.3.17
langchain-community==0.3.16
langchain-core==0.3.33
crewai==0.100.0
crewai-tools==0.33.0

2. Create a Crew using an Open AI compatible LLM instance as the LLM agent (sabia-3, for example)

3. Don´t instantiate any Open AI credential (API KEY) as we are not using their model

4. Put the ""planning"" variable of ""Crew"" as True and leaving the ""planning_llm"" as ""None""



### Expected behavior

CrewAI should respect the base_url parameter and send authentication requests to the specified provider's endpoint rather than OpenAI's servers.

Actual Behavior
CrewAI (via LiteLLM) attempts to validate the API key against OpenAI's servers regardless of the specified base_url, causing authentication failures.

### Screenshots/Code snippets

### Possible Solution

When you indicate a ""planning_llm"" inside the ""Crew"" it solves the error. The big problem is, i spent over 3 days trying to figure out why my Crew was trying to comunicate with Open AI API when i hae explicitly told the Crew to use another LLM that was compatible with it. The error message when not using an Open AI model needs to change, in order to avoid letting users loose their minds.

One solution can be add a more clear message in the documentation telling about the dependency between the ""planning"" parameter and the ""planning_llm"" parameter, as many users doens´t use Open AI to run a crew.

Another solution is to change the error message in order to be more clear about the error is really about.

3007045478,2650,[FEATURE] Improve agent/task templating,fmatray,8267716,closed,2025-04-20T14:17:59Z,2025-06-01T12:17:07Z,https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI,https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/2650,"### Feature Area

Core functionality

### Is your feature request related to a an existing bug? Please link it here.

Today, agents and tasks yaml file only support basic replacement '{variable}' with few object types: int, float, int and bool.

It would be interesting to have more options, like:
- Containers: List, Dict, Set, etc.
- Standard objects: datetime, time, etc.
- Custom objects: MyCustomObject

It would also nice to have more control, with if and loop statements, also with filtering options.

Of course, it's possible to do so doing before passing inputs. 
However, it mixes the logic and data. 
 
This could help to make more flexible agents, tasks and crew.

### Describe the solution you'd like

An easy way, would be to implement a library like Jinja2 as a templating tool: 
- It's robust and well known library and easy to implement
- it give a lot of control by having a clear separation between app's logic and agent/task templating

The main downside, is the incompatibility between action variables '{var}' and jinja ones {{var}}.


### Describe alternatives you've considered

In src/crewai/utilities/string_utils.py, instead of validating with validate_type(), just to str(variable) with a try/except to handle errors. 
As this can be an easy solution for some types like datetime, it can be more difficult with some kind of objects.

Moreover, it doesn't give any another control.

3011221694,2659,[BUG] respect_context_window doesn't work,maxkochanoff,122701199,closed,2025-04-22T14:11:20Z,2025-04-28T18:25:43Z,https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI,https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/2659,"### Description

Sometimes I run into a `litellm` error about exceeding the context window, even though the `respect_context_window` parameter is set to True by default. I thought `respect_context_window` was supposed to prevent that by automatically summarizing the text. So now I'm not sure if it's a bug or if I'm just doing something wrong. I would be very grateful if you could help me please.

P.S. In my setup, I do have some tools that are pretty lengthy (but definitely still under the maximum context length). Maybe the problem occurs when an Agent retries to call a tool after a failure (in this case there would be a lot of text in the messages).

Code that adds the erroneous parameter: https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/blob/6d0039b117b7970f01d79ed58d20efa20573fb22/src/crewai/llm.py#L341

Solution:
By removing the `stop` parameter in a custom LLM subclass the issue goes away. Example:

 ```
class LLMWithFixedStopWords(LLM):
        def _handle_streaming_response(self, params, callbacks, available_functions):

3011838502,2666,[CLARIFICATION REQUIRED] Does @listen have method_name as arguments or output strings?,ygicp,206197905,closed,2025-04-22T18:37:32Z,2025-04-22T19:11:36Z,https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI,https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/2666,"### Feature Area

### Is your feature request related to a an existing bug? Please link it here.

I want to understand the @listen functionality. How can we determine method_name vs output_string, what if a method name is what another method outputs?

```
import random
from crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, router, start
from pydantic import BaseModel

class ExampleState(BaseModel):
    success_flag: bool = False

class RouterFlow(Flow[ExampleState]):

    @start()
    def start_method(self):
        print(""Starting the structured flow"")
        random_boolean = random.choice([True, False])
        self.state.success_flag = random_boolean

    @router(start_method)
    def second_method(self):
        if self.state.success_flag:
            return ""success""
        else:
            return ""failed""

    @listen(""success"")
    def third_method(self):
        print(""Third method running"")

    @listen(""failed"")
    def fourth_method(self):
        print(""Fourth method running"")


flow = RouterFlow()
flow.kickoff()
```


### Describe the solution you'd like

```Have keyword arguments mandatory to @listen. @listen to output or @listen to method name``` - This could be written in a better way but you get my point, don't you? 

I'd be happy to raise the PR, but just don't have the time threshold upto which point I would be able to do so.

### Is your feature request related to a an existing bug? Please link it here.

Currently, I couldn't find any information in your documentation regarding how to integrate an agentic RAG setup or RAG Search Tool with Elasticsearch for more flexible storage. By default, it appears that ChromaDB is used when trying out RAG search tools like PDFSearchTool or TextSearchTool.

It would be highly beneficial if there were an option to customize the database used for storing embeddings. This flexibility would not only enhance usability for end users but also position CrewAI as a more versatile and extensible framework.

### Describe the solution you'd like

It would be great if the crewai package could be uploaded to Anaconda as well for teams working with `conda`. 

### Describe alternatives you've considered

Although `pip` can be used inside `conda` it is highly discouraged and can lead to broken environments.
I've tried to do just this and there are issues with packagess versions with both python 3.10 and 3.12 - e.g. Self from typing missing in python 3.10 and `tokenizers` package not working for python 3.12

The error appears while trying to load a JSON file inside the `litellm` dependency.

---

✅ There was **no problem** in `crewai v0.117.0`.

🚫 After upgrading to `v0.117.1`, the encoding issue started to occur.

---

**Additional Info:**
- OS: Windows 11
- Python: 3.12.6
- UV version: latest
- CrewAI installed via `uv tool install crewai`
- Running `crewai run` triggers a forced environment rebuild and dependency reinstallation.

---

**Possible Cause:**
It seems that during `crewai run`, `litellm` package tries to load a file without explicitly setting `encoding=""utf-8""` (default encoding on Windows is cp1254/cp1252, causing crash).

---

**Expected behavior:**
- CrewAI should set the correct encoding when reading files.
- Running `crewai run` should not crash immediately due to encoding issues.

---

**Temporary Workaround:**
- Downgrade CrewAI CLI back to `v0.117.0`
- or manually pin `litellm==1.67.1` and patch code to enforce UTF-8 encoding.

---




### Steps to Reproduce

Install CrewAI CLI via uv tool install crewai

Make sure you have CrewAI version v0.117.1 (uv tool list to verify).

Create a new project using crewai create crew my_project

Enter the project directory.

Run crewai run




### Expected behavior

Observe the crash: UnicodeDecodeError: 'charmap' codec can't decode byte 0x81 in position 1980

### Is your feature request related to a an existing bug? Please link it here.

NA

### Describe the solution you'd like

When I use CrewAI, I often need to pre-define the tasks and agents myself. Obviously, for complex tasks, we prefer the agents to automatically decompose it into sub-tasks and then execute them. So how can I use CrewAI to split complex tasks into relatively simple sub-tasks without having to split them manually?

NA

### Describe the solution you'd like

I really enjoy using CrewAI. I’ve utilized it to build an assistant capable of running multiple flows, each consisting of one or more crews. I appreciate the ability to reuse Agents and Tasks. My goal is to incorporate several agents.yaml and tasks.yaml files, which I can combine within the crew class.

It would be helpful if the `agents_config` and `tasks_config` in the CrewClass could accept a list. For example:
```python
agents_config = [""agents/agents_1.yaml"", ""agents/agents_2.yaml""]
tasks_config = [""tasks/tasks_1.yaml"", ""tasks/tasks_2.yaml""]
```

Thank you!

Add a loop to the `def load_configurations(self):` in `def CrewBase(cls: T) -> T:` (crew_base.py)  may do the trick.

3037076201,2744,[BUG]  IndexError in litellm when CrewAI Agent with Tools uses Ollama/Qwen,truecalifornian,167336983,closed,2025-05-03T01:45:48Z,2025-05-06T13:02:05Z,https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI,https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/2744,"### Description

## Bug Report: IndexError in litellm when CrewAI Agent with Tools uses Ollama/Qwen

**Affected Libraries:** `crewai`, `litellm`
**LLM Provider:** Ollama
**Model:** `qwen3:4b` (or specific Qwen 1.5 variant used)

**Description:**
When using CrewAI with an agent configured to use an Ollama model (specifically tested with `qwen3`) via `litellm`, an `IndexError: list index out of range` occurs within `litellm`'s Ollama prompt templating logic. This error specifically happens during the LLM call that follows a successful tool execution by the agent. If the agent does *not* have tools assigned, the error does not occur.

The error originates in `litellm/litellm_core_utils/prompt_templates/factory.py` when attempting to access `messages[msg_i].get(""tool_calls"")`, suggesting an incompatibility in how the message history (including the tool call and its result/observation) is structured or processed for Ollama after a tool run.

**Expected Behavior:**

The agent should successfully process the tool's output and continue its execution by making the next LLM call without errors.

**Actual Behavior:**

The script crashes during the LLM call *after* the tool execution. An `IndexError: list index out of range` occurs within `litellm`, wrapped in a `litellm.exceptions.APIConnectionError`. The Crew/Task fails.

````



### Steps to Reproduce

1.  Set up CrewAI to use an Ollama model (e.g., `qwen3`) as the LLM provider via `litellm`.
2.  Define a CrewAI Agent and assign one or more tools (e.g., `DuckDuckGoSearchTool`) to it using the `tools=[...]` parameter.
3.  Define a Task for this agent that requires it to use one of the assigned tools.
4.  Execute the task using `crew.kickoff()` (or within a CrewAI Flow).
5.  Observe the agent successfully executing the tool.
6.  Observe the subsequent attempt by CrewAI/`litellm` to make the next LLM call to Ollama (to process the tool results).

### Expected behavior

The agent should successfully process the tool's output and continue its execution by making the next LLM call without errors.

3039746488,2755,[Question] How to load pre-existing embeddings as Knowledge Source?,sabaul,66197673,closed,2025-05-05T13:50:24Z,2025-05-12T12:14:45Z,https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI,https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/2755,"### Description

### Summary

I'm trying to pass a custom knowledge source (that subclasses `KnowledgeStorage`, which itself inherits `BaseKnowledgeStorage`) into the `knowledge_sources` parameter of a `Crew`.

Here is my implementation of the CustomKnowledgeSource:

```
import chromadb
from chromadb.config import Settings
from crewai.knowledge.storage.knowledge_storage import KnowledgeStorage


class CustomKnowledgeStorage(KnowledgeStorage):
    def __init__(self, persist_directory: str, embedder=None, collection_name=None):
        self.persist_directory = persist_directory
        super().__init__(embedder=embedder, collection_name=collection_name)
    
    def initialize_knowledge_storage(self):
        chroma_client = chromadb.PersistentClient(
            path=self.persist_directory,
            settings=Settings(allow_reset=True),
        )
        self.app = chroma_client
        try:
            collection_name = (
                ""knowledge"" if not self.collection_name else self.collection_name
            )
            self.collection = self.app.get_or_create_collection(
                name=collection_name,
                embedding_function=self.embedder,
            )
        except Exception as e:
            raise Exception(f""Failed to create or get collection: {e}"")
```

This is how I was trying to load the existing vector embedding:
```
def get_supported_knowledge_sources(folder_name: str, embedder=None):
    persist_path = f""vectorstores/knowledge_{folder_name}""
    storage = CustomKnowledgeStorage(persist_directory=persist_path, embedder=embedder, collection_name=folder_name)
    storage.initialize_knowledge_storage()
    return [storage]
```

and then pass it on to the crew:

```
    @crew
    def crew(self) -> Crew:
        """"""Creates the Test crew""""""

        return Crew(
            agents=self.agents,
            tasks=self.tasks,
            process=Process.sequential,
            verbose=True,
            knowledge_sources=get_supported_knowledge_sources(
                org_name=self.org_name,
                chunk_size=self.chunk_size,
                chunk_overlap=self.chunk_overlap,
            )
        )
```


But I am getting this error:
```
An error occurred while running the crew: 1 validation error for Crew\nknowledge_sources.0\n  Input should be a valid dictionary or instance of BaseKnowledgeSource [type=model_type, input_value=<src.att_pl_ag.knowledge_...t at 0x0000011BBD208D50>, input_type=CustomKnowledgeStorage]\n    For further information visit https://errors.pydantic.dev/2.11/v/model_type""
```

From what I understand, since the custom class inherits from KnowledgeSource which inherits from BaseKnowledgeSource, shouldn't this work?

Regardless, the idea is to not embed at runtime, keep creating/appending to the knowledge sources and adding to the ChromaDB and then query based on the existing knowledge source. Also this existing knowledge source could be passed to other agents/crews as well.


## Question
* What is the proper way to pass a pre-initialized, custom KnowledgeStorage into a Crew without triggering re-embedding?

* If there is a better way to do this or implement this, even that helps

Would appreciate any help, thank you.

### Steps to Reproduce

Create any basic crew with agents and task with the instructions to only answer with the existing knowledge source or files provided.

and pass the CustomKnowledgeSource object to the class and see how it works.

### Expected behavior

Load an existing vector embedding chromadb instance, and pass that to the knowledge source in crew or agent.

### Screenshots/Code snippets

### Operating System

### Python Version

3.11

### crewAI Version

### crewAI Tools Version

### Virtual Environment

### Possible Solution

.

### Additional context

I tried adding dummy files and creating fake File_type_KnowledeSources as well, as well as with empty file_paths parameter, but that also doesn't work. CrewAI starts the embedding process again, as soon as those are used (e.g. PDFKnowledgeSource)

this was the code used to try that:
```
def get_supported_knowledge_sources(folder_name: str, embedder=None):
    base_path = f""knowledge/{folder_name}""
    persist_path = f""vectorstores/knowledge_{folder_name}""
    storage = CustomKnowledgeStorage(persist_directory=persist_path, embedder=embedder, collection_name=folder_name)
    storage.initialize_knowledge_storage()

    source_map = {
        ""text"": {""extensions"": [""txt"", ""md"", ""mdx""], ""class"": TextFileKnowledgeSource},
        ""pdf"": {""extensions"": [""pdf""], ""class"": PDFKnowledgeSource},
        ""csv"": {""extensions"": [""csv""], ""class"": CSVKnowledgeSource},
        ""excel"": {""extensions"": [""xls"", ""xlsx""], ""class"": ExcelKnowledgeSource},
        ""json"": {""extensions"": [""json""], ""class"": JSONKnowledgeSource},
    }

    sources = []

    for config in source_map.values():
        matched_files = []
        for ext in config[""extensions""]:
            matched_files.extend(glob.glob(f""{base_path}/**/*.{ext}"", recursive=True))
        if not matched_files:
            continue

        relative_paths = [f.replace(""knowledge/"", """", 1) for f in matched_files]
        relative_paths = []

        source = config[""class""](
            file_paths=relative_paths,
            collection_name=folder_name,
        )
        source.storage = storage
        sources.append(source)

    return sources
```

But does not work as intended, any suggestions would be appreciated"

Agent capabilities

### Is your feature request related to a an existing bug? Please link it here.

While developing custom tooling, or adjusting settings in a small area within a large Crew it would be very useful to be able to rerun the entire job without invoking actual network calls. Running CrewAI offline would allow to evaluate changes that don't impact LLM output.

1) Faster iteration
2) Runs offline without networking
3) Predictable results / can be shared / used in tests
4) Does not use up tokens and lowers cost during development



### Describe the solution you'd like

This could be enabled by executing the job once with `crewai run --record` flag and later with `crewai run --replay`

### Describe alternatives you've considered

1) Could be done on Agent level where the agent notices the run mode and answers a cached value instead of executing its task
2) Could be done on LLM specification where Agent acts correctly, but LLM caches results
3) Could be done on networking layer which would store HAR files

### Additional context

What exactly is saved on disk needs to be strongly considered. HAR files would need to be sanitized for auth information etc.

I am updating the data in CSV knowledge source but its agent is not picking it on next run. It is picking the old data. 

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Create CSV data file and add it in knowledge folder. 
2. Configure it as knowledge source for Agent

 ```
    csv_source = CSVKnowledgeSource(file_paths=[""referral_data_details.csv""])
    @agent
    def healthcare_professional(self) -> Agent:

				""config"": {
					""model"": ""models/text-embedding-004"",
					""api_key"": GEMINI_API_KEY,

```
3. Run command line - `crewai run`. It picks up the correct data
4. Change the first line in CSV to fetch new data
5. Run command line again. But it still fetches the old data

## Task: Criar o Canvas MVP para o projeto Volare considerando propostas de valor, features, personas, métricas de sucesso, hipóteses de negócio, e estratégias de validação. O projeto envolve a prevenção da 'Mosca do Estábulo', que afeta a qualidade do gado devido ao não uso de fogo para queimar restos de cana de açúcar desde 2009, tornando o ambiente propício para moscas. O MVP deve resolver o problema das demoras, facilitando a captura de dados através de fotos para gerar relatórios imediatos e melhorar a aparência profissional.

## Tool Output:
I have compiled a comprehensive desk research report on the Volare project, which is focused on ""Stable Fly"" prevention for sugarcane mills in Brazil. Here is the structured report:

1. **Mapeamento de Concorrentes:**
   - **Concorrentes Diretos:**
     - Solitude® IGR: Produto de prevenção econômica ingerido junto ao alimento, prevenindo a proliferação de moscas.
     - Bite Free™ Stable Fly Trap: Ampla oferta de soluções de armadilhamento e repelência disponível via Arbico Organics.
     - Revenge Barn & Stable Fly Spray: Fórmula premium que duplica os ingredientes de concorrentes, visando o controle de pragas em estábulos.

   - **Concorrentes Indiretos:**
     - Outras soluções de controle de insetos que englobam prevenção multi-moscas e repelentes naturais ou químicos.

   - **Diferenciais Competitivos:**
     - Solitude utiliza ingredientes como Cyromazine, e as variações nas formas de formulação (sprays vs. armadilhas).

   - **Modelo de Monetização:**
     - Vendidos principalmente através de plataformas de e-commerce ou diretamente nos sites dos fabricantes.

2. **Análise de Mercado:**
   - **TAM, SAM, SOM:** Estima-se que o mercado de controle biológico alcance USD 4,01 bilhões em 2025, com um crescimento anual projetado de 7,03% até 2030.
   - **Taxas de Crescimento e Tendências:** Mudança para métodos de controle de pragas mais sustentáveis e ecológicos.
   - **Barreiras de Entrada:** Aprovações regulatórias, conscientização do consumidor e investimentos em infraestrutura tecnológica.

3. **Perfil do Público-Alvo:**
   - **Demográficos:** Pequenos e grandes agricultores de pecuária e usinas de açúcar.
   - **Necessidades Não Atendidas:** Dificuldade na distinção das moscas alvo e necessidade de transferência rápida de dados para gestão de surtos.
   - **Jornada do Cliente:** Começa do reconhecimento de problema, pesquisa de soluções até compra e pós-compra.

4. **Oportunidades e Ameaças (Análise SWOT):**
   - **Forças:** Disponibilidade de pesquisas científicas comprovadas, aumento da consciência por soluções eco-amigáveis.
   - **Fraquezas:** Limitações orçamentárias e resistência a adaptação de novos produtos.
   - **Oportunidades:** Aumento de setores de energia renovável ligados a industriade cana-de-açúcar.
   - **Ameaças:** Competição de produtos estabelecidos, mudanças regulatórias potencialmente adversas.
   - **Mitigação de Riscos:** Inovações de processo ágeis, marketing simplificado para aumentar a adoção e parcerias para penetração de mercado.

5. **Análise Tecnológica:**
   - **Tecnologias Emergentes:** Sensoriamento remoto para detectar assinatura térmica específica de moscas, formulações de biopesticidas melhoradas.
   - **Infraestrutura Necessária:** Plataformas em nuvem e análise de dados para monitoramento em tempo real.
   - **Benchmark Técnico:** Considerando facilidade, custo e praticidade na transferência de tecnologia.
   - **Viabilidade:** Soluções na nuvem podem ser mais baratas que a infraestrutura física, oferecendo escalabilidade com o orçamento da Volare.

6. **Recomendações Estratégicas:**
   - **Direções de Produto:** Focar em soluções ecoamigáveis, facilidade de aplicação e retorno sustentável.
   - **Estratégias Go-To-Market:** Utilizar campanhas de mídia social direcionadas a produtores agrícolas eco-conscientes.
   - **KPIs:** Redução na população de moscas, pontuações de satisfação do cliente, e tempo de resolução de problemas.
   - **Próximos Passos:** Desenvolver grupo beta para teste de produto, pesquisas adicionais em sistemas de integração e monitoramento contínuo da satisfação do cliente para melhorias iterativas.

Esta pesquisa representa uma análise abrangente para a Volare, focando em fortalecer sua posição no mercado de prevenção à ""Mosca do Estábulo"".

3047216955,2776,[FEATURE] Mem0 Memory transition to V2,rusXL,125464973,open,2025-05-07T21:32:26Z,,https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI,https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/2776,"### Feature Area

Integration with external tools.
CrewAI currently has an option to use Mem0 for short-term, long-term, and external memory.
It would be beneficial to maintain it updated and configurable.

### Describe the solution you'd like

The Mem0 has moved to [v2](https://docs.mem0.ai/features/contextual-add#version-2-recommended).

This includes: 
1. First, support for memories associated with a specific conversation session or interaction with the help of `run_id` [param](https://docs.mem0.ai/features/contextual-add#using-user-id-with-run-id) for short-term memory.
2. Secondly, there is no ability to turn off agent memories. The agent name is always being passed as agent ID with every add API call, but in some situations, it is necessary that agents are memory-less.
3. Thirdly, it would be cool to have support for mem0 [new features](https://docs.mem0.ai/features/platform-overview) such as (I find the most relevant once) `memory inclusion`, `custom categories`.
4. And last but not least, it would be great to move from deprecated search v1 to search v2 - [mem0 api reference](https://docs.mem0.ai/api-reference/memory/v2-search-memories).

I suggest updating [Mem0Storage class](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/blob/main/src/crewai/memory/storage/mem0_storage.py)

### Describe alternatives you've considered

_No response_

### Additional context

_No response_

### Willingness to Contribute

I can test the feature once it's implemented. 
I can try implementing it as well, just give me the instructions on how to create a branch for Mem0?"

Can't reproduce the example at [Example Crew Class with Decorators](https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/crews#example-crew-class-with-decorators)

### Steps to Reproduce

- Setup and copy code from [Example Crew Class with Decorators](https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/crews#example-crew-class-with-decorators).
- Add `c = YourCrewName()` and `c.kickoff()` at the end of file.
- Run your script.

### Expected behaviour

The example should run.

My expectation is that if an Agent has 3 tools and I assign it a task that has 1 tool then the final execution will be able to leverage 4 tools. This is not true. Final execution will only leverage 1 tool from the task.

myagent = Agent(..., tools=[generic_tool1, generic_tool2, generic_tool3])
mytask = Task(..., tools=[task_specific_tool], agent=myagent)

3054012927,2803,[BUG]Gemini Model Fails in CrewAI Due to LiteLLM API Key + Model Parsing Issues,MathavanSG,121884337,closed,2025-05-10T10:43:45Z,2025-05-11T05:19:09Z,https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI,https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/2803,"### Description

Using Google Gemini models with CrewAI via crewai.LLM or langchain_google_genai.ChatGoogleGenerativeAI fails due to litellm.BadRequestError, even with a valid API key from Google AI Studio and a supported model like models/gemini-pro.



# Root Cause
```
crewai.LLM routes Gemini calls through litellm, but:

litellm expects GEMINI_API_KEY, not GOOGLE_API_KEY.

It fails to map models/gemini-pro to a valid provider because it doesn’t match provider/model format.

Even using ChatGoogleGenerativeAI from LangChain directly still fails inside CrewAI because Crew's execution layer tries to route through litellm.
```



### Steps to Reproduce

```python
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew, LLM
import os

# Set API key from Google AI Studio
os.environ[""GOOGLE_API_KEY""] = ""AIzaSy...""

llm = LLM(model=""gemini/gemini-pro"", temperature=0.7)

agent = Agent(role=""AI Expert"", goal=""Explain things"", backstory=""Expert"", llm=llm)

task = Task(
    description=""Explain tokenization"",
    expected_output=""Simple explanation"",
    agent=agent
)

crew = Crew(agents=[agent], tasks=[task], verbose=True)
crew.kickoff()
```

### Expected behavior

# Error Output
```
BadRequestError: LLM Provider NOT provided. Pass in the LLM provider you are trying to call. You passed model=models/gemini-pro

```
or

```
litellm.AuthenticationError: geminiException - {
  ""error"": {

    ""message"": ""API key not valid. Please pass a valid API key.""

### Possible Solution


CrewAI+Gemini is currently broken, but LangChain+Gemini is stable and works perfectly — just use it outside CrewAI for now.


### Additional context

langchain_google_genai.ChatGoogleGenerativeAI is fully supported and works — but only outside CrewAI (as of now)."
3054067595,2805,Fix: Enable Gemini support via GOOGLE_API_KEY fallback and explicit api_key injection,MathavanSG,121884337,open,2025-05-10T11:49:24Z,,https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI,https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2805,"This PR fixes Gemini integration in CrewAI when using `crewai.LLM` with API keys from Google AI Studio.

### Problem

- Most Gemini users export `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, not `GEMINI_API_KEY`
- LiteLLM (used by CrewAI) only checks for `GEMINI_API_KEY`
- This causes `key=None` and results in `API_KEY_INVALID` or 400 errors

### Fix

- Adds fallback logic: if `GEMINI_API_KEY` is not found, use `GOOGLE_API_KEY`
- Explicitly injects `params[""api_key""] = self.api_key` in `_prepare_completion_params`
- Now Gemini models like `models/gemini-pro` work out of the box with Google API keys

### Tested with:
- `models/gemini-pro`
- `GOOGLE_API_KEY` only
- Received correct output from Gemini via CrewAI agent

Verified working end-to-end. Fixes a common developer experience blocker.

This issue https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/2738 said it implemented the LLM(model=""o3"", stop=None) but it does not appear to work 

### Additional context

It would be great to get this working as this also affect LLM(model=""o4-mini"", stop=None)"

I'm using a my Python 3.10 environment. Running `python main.py` works successfully.

However, when I run a `crewai` command, I encounter the following issue:

3073990367,2862,[BUG] Incorrect Official documentation on Custom LLM,georgebe,11427508,closed,2025-05-19T14:10:51Z,2025-05-27T17:08:41Z,https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI,https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/2862,"### Description

Hey Team, 

Please see this thread. There is a discrepancy between official crewAI documentation and BaseLLM abstract class implementation. Please see details below
https://community.crewai.com/t/customllm-implementation-error/5829 

Kindly take action to either update the doc or remove the model attribute as mandatory input while initializing BaseLLM

### Steps to Reproduce

Steps to replicate are provided in the community thread. 

### Expected behavior

Either documentation should be updated or BaseLLM

### Screenshots/Code snippets

You’re right. There’s an issue with the official documentation. Take a look at how the BaseLLM abstract class is defined [in the source code](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/blob/aa6e5b703e4b530fdddd2e8a3ed1326b0db451cc/src/crewai/llms/base_llm.py#L5):

class BaseLLM(ABC):
    model: str # <= This 'model' attribute is currently required by the constructor.
    temperature: Optional[float] = None
    stop: Optional[List[str]] = None
So, you have to pass a model string. Generally, this makes sense because, after all, you’ll usually need a model name when making an API call, right? But this attribute isn’t actually used explicitly by the BaseLLM class itself after initialization, so you can just pass any string, like this:

class CustomLLM(BaseLLM):
    """"""
    Example of a custom LLM implementation.
    
    This class demonstrates how to initialize the mandatory 'model' 
    attribute required by the BaseLLM superclass.
    """"""
    def __init__(self, api_key: str, endpoint: str):
        super().__init__(model=""BelsianLLM"") 
        
        # ... and any other setup your LLM needs (e.g., API client).
Ideally, either the official documentation should be updated to mention that model must be passed to super().__init__(), or the abstract class code itself should be changed to model: Optional[str] = None to make it truly optional if it’s not used.

### Operating System

macOS Catalina

### Python Version

3.12

### crewAI Version

 0.120.1

### crewAI Tools Version

Not applicable

### Virtual Environment

Venv

### Evidence

I get into an error “TypeError: BaseLLM.init() missing 1 required positional argument: ‘model’” . Its expecting “model” as one of the parameter. But I don’t see that in the examples provided. Is there a disconnect between the python SDK and documentation ?

I am using crewai SDK Version: 0.120.1

Example snippet from the documentation
class CustomLLM(BaseLLM):
def init(self, api_key: str, endpoint: str):

### Possible Solution

Either documentation should be updated or BaseLLM

### Additional context

Either documentation should be updated or BaseLLM"

There should be clear and comprehensive documentation for using a custom pgvector as the knowledge storage in CrewAI. This should include setup instructions, configuration details, example use cases, and troubleshooting tips for users who want to use or integrate a custom pgvector database as their knowledge storage backend.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
I tried searching the existing documentation and repository wiki, but could not find detailed information about configuring or using a custom pgvector as the knowledge storage.

**Additional context**
Proper documentation will help users and contributors effectively use, configure, and extend CrewAI with a custom pgvector knowledge storage option.

**Willingness to Contribute:**
I can test the feature once it's implemented.

Hi! I noticed VS Code suggests allow_feedback, allow_conflict, and allow_iteration when creating Agents. Are these experimental, or officially supported parameters in CrewAI? Could you clarify their purpose if any? Because I used them with each agent and I got no error back while running the crew.

### Is your feature request related to a an existing bug? Please link it here.

According to the A2A protocol, agents should maintain bidirectional interaction (full-duplex) during task execution. However, in CrewAI, the cooperate mechanism is task-driven and requires a task to bind only one agent. When an agent is invoked by another agent (rather than by a task), it cannot recursively invoke other agents during task execution. This limitation prevents full compliance with the A2A protocol. Are there plans to resolve this issue in future updates?

I am relying on new features released in openai 1.78 distribution related to multi image input support. However CrewAI 0.121.0 is locked to openai 1.75.

Agent capabilities

### Is your feature request related to a an existing bug? Please link it here.

Currently, setting `allow_delegation = True` lets the agent delegate the task to all the agents specified in the crew.

However, I want a more constrained delegation process where say agent A is only allowed to delegate to agebt B, C, while agent D is allowed to delegate to all.


### Describe the solution you'd like

- Specifying something like `target_agents=[]` along with `allow_delegation = True` in the agent definition should help solve this.

- Maybe its even possible to have multiple crews interact with each other, and then you wouldn't need `target_agents`.

### Describe alternatives you've considered

Maybe I can do this via prompting, however, it seems too chaotic for the agent to handle all that.

3102505655,2919,[BUG] Unexpected embedchain dependency conflict when upgrading crewai and related packages,souravdutta999,140061075,open,2025-05-30T08:40:59Z,,https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI,https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/2919,"### Description

Hi CrewAI team,

I'm reporting an issue related to a dependency conflict that occurred while upgrading **crewai** and **crewai-tools** in an existing project.

### **Background**
_I originally had the following versions in my project:_

crewai==0.100.1
crewai-tools==0.0.1
langchain==0.3.20
langchain-community==0.3.8
langchain-openai==0.2.14
openai==0.58.1
llama-index==0.10.51

_I upgraded to:_

crewai==0.121.0
crewai-tools==0.45.0
langchain==0.3.25
langchain-community==0.3.24
langchain-openai==0.3.3
openai==1.75.0
llama-index==0.12.38

During this upgrade process, I encountered a conflict related to **embedchain==0.1.128**, even though I never explicitly installed or used it in my project.

### **Problem**

After upgrading crewai and its dependencies, embedchain was being installed indirectly. This introduced multiple version conflicts and dependency issues, especially with llama-index. I had to manually upgrade llama-index just to make things work.

This led me to believe that embedchain might be getting pulled in indirectly through one of the upgraded dependencies, possibly without being declared explicitly.

### Steps to Reproduce

Follow these steps to reproduce the issue where embedchain is unexpectedly installed as a transitive dependency during a typical GenAI stack setup.

### **1. Create a clean virtual environment**
I have used:

python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

### **2. Install the base dependencies**
pip install \
  langchain==0.3.25 \
  langchain-community==0.3.24 \
  langchain-openai==0.3.3 \
  openai==1.75.0 \
  llama-index==0.10.51  # Upgraded later to resolve conflict

### **3. Install CrewAI packages**
pip install \
  crewai==0.121.0 \
  crewai-tools==0.45.0

### **4. Observe embedchain unexpectedly installed**
At this point, a dependency conflict is triggered. Following symptoms can be observed then:

**llama-index==0.10.51** becomes incompatible due to transitive requirements introduced by **crewai** or **crewai-tools**.
As a result, **llama-index** should be upgraded.
This newer version of **llama-index** has an undocumented transitive dependency on **embedchain**.
**embedchain** and its dependencies get installed automatically, even though it is not explicitly required in the project.



### Expected behavior

- Installing crewai==0.121.0 and crewai-tools==0.45.0 **should not introduce transitive dependencies** like embedchain unless they are explicitly required by the user or listed in the direct dependency tree.
- If llama-index has a dependency on embedchain, that dependency should:
     - Be clearly documented in its pyproject.toml / setup.py or PyPI listing.
     - Be managed via optional extras or behind feature flags, not as a hard dependency.
- The overall package ecosystem (e.g., crewai → llama-index → embedchain) should **honor minimal, non-intrusive dependency inclusion**, especially for large or unrelated packages like embedchain.
- Installing crewai should not break or forcefully upgrade critical packages like:
     - llama-index
     - langchain
     - openai
 unless explicitly documented in release notes or version constraints.

### Possible Solution

- **Upgrade** _llama-index_: Initially, the conflict with embedchain was resolved by upgrading llama-index from 0.10.51 to 0.12.38, as the older version had incompatible dependencies when used with crewai==0.121.0.
- However, even after upgrading llama-index, crewai is still not working as expected. Specifically, while implementing custom tools using **CrewAgentExecutor**, I am facing unexpected errors or breakages. This indicates that the dependency resolution is not the only issue — there may be underlying integration or runtime incompatibilities between crewai, crewai-tools, and the newer versions of llama-index or other components like langchain.
- ### Suggested action:
   - Improve compatibility validation between crewai, crewai-tools, and the supported versions of llama-index, langchain, and openai.
   - Clearly document required versions or known incompatibilities.
   - Consider isolating experimental or breaking changes behind optional flags or extras to avoid unintentional downstream breakage for users with existing production setups.

Currently, when setting allow_code_execution=True for an agent, CrewAI executes the code inside a sandboxed Docker environment. However, there is no documented way to customize or override the Docker image used for that environment.

This creates limitations when trying to execute code that requires additional Python packages (e.g., matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, etc.), which are not pre-installed in the default container. As a result, users either face runtime errors (e.g., ModuleNotFoundError) or have to implement manual workarounds.

Right now, users can define a custom tool that mounts and runs Docker manually (e.g., using subprocess with docker run) — but this is outside the scope of CrewAI’s built-in execution feature and limits agent autonomy and task simplicity.

### Describe the solution you'd like

Introduce a mechanism to specify a custom Docker image when enabling allow_code_execution=True. This could be done via:

A new optional argument in the Agent class (e.g., execution_image='my-custom-image')

Or via a global environment variable (e.g., CREWAI_CODE_EXEC_IMAGE)

CrewAI would then spawn code execution containers using the provided image instead of the default.

### Describe alternatives you've considered

_No response_

### Additional context

Benefits
Enables agents to run domain-specific or data science code (e.g., charting, ML) without hacky dynamic installs.

Provides developers full control over the execution environment.

Aligns with secure practices where containers are pre-built and verified for dependencies and safety.

Encourages better reproducibility and portability across systems and teams.

### Describe the solution you'd like

I have created multi-agent system with 5agents and 5 tasks related to forecasting, news extraction, holiday information, macroeconomic extraction and user query agent. If user is asking query then it should run the specific agent and task only. But currently it is running all 5 agents which is time consuming. In the end it gives answer to related question only but in the backend it runs the entire process.I am sharing sample snippets
I am giving you some sample snippets
crew = Crew(
    agents=[holiday_agent, macro_agent, news_summarizer_agent, analysis_forecast_agent,user_query_agent ],
    tasks=[holiday_task, macro_task, news_summarizer_task, analysis_forecast_task,user_query_task],
    process=Process.sequential,
    verbose = True
)
 
input = {'data_file': 'sample.csv',
         'action': 'forecast',
         'country_code': 'US',
         'topic': 'Egg_prices',
         'query':""Provide forecasted result on the input data"" }
 
 
# Kick off the crew, providing the file path in the inputs
crew_result = crew.kickoff(inputs=input)
 
I have custom tools for first 4 agents. so ideally for this particular query mentioned in the input process should use only agent and task related to forecasting but currently it is running all the task. 
Please provide suggestion for this issue.
expected output- for this query it should go to agent and task related to forecasting only.(not holiday of macro agents)

### Describe alternatives you've considered

I tried to create 5th agent to handle user query but it is not helping

        ""understand the user question and determine what user wants.Do not use your own knowledge to answer the question.\n""
        ""Use context and result generated by other tasks.\n""
        ""We have built a synergic agent workflow combining forecasting,holiday information, macroeconomic data extraction, news summarization.\n""

Hi!

I'm Sergey from the Integrations team over at [AI/ML API](https://aimlapi.com/), a startup with 150K+ users, providing over 300 AI models in one place. Pretty sure that we've sponsored a couple events in SF together with you guys

Your project looks dope, so we'd like to have a native integration with it. We already got integrations with Langflow, Agno, and AutoGPT - so our integrations team is pretty seasoned :)

Say you're interested, and we'll test the compatibility, update the code/docs to include us, create a PR and add a tutorial on using crewai with AI/ML API to our docs

If you give us a green light, we could implement this next week

In [`src/crewai/task.py`](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/blob/db1e9e9b9a689bf85f12e2f848f24f2d31518530/src/crewai/task.py#L98-L101), the `context` field is annotated as `Optional[List[""Task""]]`, but the default value is set to `NOT_SPECIFIED`, which is neither `None` nor a `List[""Task""]`. This could cause confusion for type checkers and consumers of the API.

```python
context: Optional[List[""Task""]] = Field(
    description=""Other tasks that will have their output used as context for this task."",
    default=NOT_SPECIFIED,
)
```

### Steps to Reproduce

See description

### Expected behavior

The type annotation should include `NOT_SPECIFIED` as a valid value, or the default should be changed to `None` if only `None` or `List[""Task""]` are allowed

Currently when you set `allow_code_execution=True,` and you are running in Docker you get an error. 

`   raise RuntimeError(
RuntimeError: Docker is not installed. Please install Docker to use code execution with agent: Knowledge Pattern Synthesizera`

CrewAI runs well for everything else in docker and the only workaround is to set `run_codes = CodeInterpreterTool(unsafe_mode=True)` this is not ideal.

Can we resolve the issue to work in Docker or state in the Documentation that CrewAI does work work with Docker to run code. 

### Steps to Reproduce

Create a standard agent and turn on the flag in the agent

            allow_code_execution=True,

Following https://docs.crewai.com/learn/coding-agents

Agent capabilities

### Is your feature request related to a an existing bug? Please link it here.

No

### Describe the solution you'd like

Hi CrewAI team 👋

Thanks for building such an elegant and modular agent framework — it’s been a joy to work with CrewAI!

### 💡 Feature Request

I'd like to request **support for fallback LLMs at the Agent level**, to improve robustness and flexibility in production environments.

### 🚩 Motivation

Currently, each agent is tied to a single `llm` instance. However, in real-world scenarios, LLMs may:

* Fail due to latency or API issues
* Produce poor or incomplete responses
* Exceed rate limits

Having a fallback mechanism — where another LLM is tried if the first one fails — would significantly increase the reliability of multi-agent tasks.

### ✅ Example API

```python
Agent(
    role=""primary_researcher"",
    goal=""Extract insights from the document"",
    llm=gpt4,
    fallback=[qwen3, mistral7b]
)
```

### 🔧 Expected Behavior

* If `gpt4` fails (timeout, error, or poor output), CrewAI should automatically try `qwen3`, then `mistral7b` as a last resort.
* Ideally, the fallback can be configured to trigger on specific error types or confidence thresholds.

### 🧠 Why This Matters

* Enables graceful degradation during outages
* Reduces failure points in production deployments
* Allows for cost-performance tradeoffs (e.g., fall back from expensive LLMs to cheaper ones)

Let me know if this fits with the project vision — I’d be happy to contribute or collaborate on a PR if helpful!

Thanks again for your incredible work 🙏

3165206702,3043,[BUG] Pydantic Schema Validation in CrewAI Events,jfbraman,212654007,open,2025-06-21T16:24:29Z,,https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI,https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/3043,"### Description

When integrating CrewAI agents with Render, we encountered a Pydantic validation error in **LLMCallStartedEvent** due to an internal `TokenCalcHandler` object being passed instead of a plain `dict`. This is a regression caused by Pydantic v2’s `dict_type` checks.

uname -a
Linux srv-d1as1mer433s73adehbg-5db4c57b6-wqkdf 6.8.0-1023-aws #25~22.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Tue Jan 28 12:51:22 UTC 2025 x86_64 GNU/Linux

Environment

- **CrewAI version**: Latest PyPI release (Pydantic v2)
- **Python**: 3.13
- **Context**: Running on Render with telemetry enabled by default

Issue

**Error message**:

```
ValidationError: 1 validation error for LLMCallStartedEvent
tools.0
  Input should be a valid dictionary [type=dict_type, input_value=<TokenCalcHandler object>, input_type=TokenCalcHandler]
```

**Root cause**: CrewAI’s `LLMCallStartedEvent` schema expects `tools: List[dict]`, but internally attaches a `TokenCalcHandler` instance in its `tools` list. Pydantic’s `dict_type` check now rejects non-`dict` entries.


Linux srv-d1as1mer433s73adehbg-5db4c57b6-wqkdf 6.8.0-1023-aws #25~22.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Tue Jan 28 12:51:22 UTC 2025 x86_64 GNU/Linux


### Steps to Reproduce

Minimal Reproduction

python
from crewai.llm import LLM
from crewai.utilities.events.llm_events import LLMCallStartedEvent

# Simulate internal injection
event = LLMCallStartedEvent(
    messages=[...],
    tools=[{""name"": ""tool1""}, TokenCalcHandler(...)],
    token_handler=TokenCalcHandler(...)
)
# Raises ValidationError on initialization


### Expected behavior

Please update the CrewAI codebase to handle non-`dict` tool objects gracefully in `LLMCallStartedEvent`, and consider disabling telemetry or sanitizing events by default. This will prevent users from needing invasive monkey-patches and ensure compatibility with Pydantic v2.

### Screenshots/Code snippets

# Simulate internal injection
event = LLMCallStartedEvent(
    messages=[...],
    tools=[{""name"": ""tool1""}, TokenCalcHandler(...)],
    token_handler=TokenCalcHandler(...)
)
# Raises ValidationError on initialization

### Operating System

Other (specify in additional context)

### Python Version

3.12

### crewAI Version

 crewai: 0.130.0

### crewAI Tools Version

pydantic: 2.11.7

### Virtual Environment

Venv

### Evidence

ValidationError: 1 validation error for LLMCallStartedEvent
tools.0
  Input should be a valid dictionary [type=dict_type, input_value=<TokenCalcHandler object>, input_type=TokenCalcHandler]

### Possible Solution

1. **Schema change** in CrewAI: make `tools: List[Union[dict, Any]]` or filter out unknown types before validation.
2. **Optional field**: mark `token_handler` in the `LLMCallStartedEvent` model as `Optional[Any]` and exclude it from schema validation.
3. **Utility filter**: add `.dict(exclude_unset=True, filter_func=isinstance(dict))` internally.

### Additional context

## Workaround (for users)

```python
import os
os.environ[""CREWAI_DISABLE_TELEMETRY""] = ""true""

# Monkey-patch event init to filter tools
from crewai.utilities.events.llm_events import LLMCallStartedEvent
_orig_init = LLMCallStartedEvent.__init__
def _safe_init(self, *args, tools=None, **kwargs):
    if isinstance(tools, list):
        tools = [t for t in tools if isinstance(t, dict)]
    kwargs.pop(""token_handler"", None)
    return _orig_init(self, *args, tools=tools, **kwargs)
LLMCallStartedEvent.__init__ = _safe_init
```

This PR updates the E2B Code Interpreter Tool implementation with the following changes:

1. Removed unsupported 'envs' argument from the tool initialization
2. Kept the manual close() approach for better flexibility (as the tool might be called multiple times)
3. Verified imports in both __init__.py files

## Testing
- [x] Verified code changes
- [x] Confirmed imports are properly set up
- [ ] Waiting for CI checks to complete

## Changes Made
- Removed 'envs' argument from __init__ and CodeInterpreter constructor
- Documented the decision to keep manual close() approach
- Maintained existing functionality while removing unsupported features

**Can we make the CrewAI tool dependency to embedchain optional?** . There was an issue raised in this regard to make dependency to embedchain optional - https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-tools/pull/292.
However the latest versions of crewAI tool definition still have the dependency to embedchain.

Reasons:

1. The current version of embedchain (v0.1.128) depends on langchain-cohere versions <0.4.0, which in turn **depend** on the **experimental package langchain-experimental**. This **experimental package has known security issues**. Updating embedchain to use a newer version of langchain-cohere (e.g., v0.4.1 or later) would eliminate this dependency and resolve the security risks. However the team has not yet fixed it.
Because of he risks flagged by various security scanner tools, they are blocked by Enterprise security scanners. This prevents the adoption of CrewAI.
2. If embedchain is only an optional librray, it should be made as ""optional"" dependency.

## Overview
This PR implements retry logic for update propagation to improve reliability in networks where peers are not directly connected. The changes address the update propagation issues observed in the live Freenet network, particularly in applications like River where users cannot join rooms reliably.

## Implementation Details
1. Added retry logic for update broadcasting with exponential backoff:
   - `MAX_RETRIES=10` - Same as the subscription system
   - `BASE_DELAY_MS=100` - Start with a small delay
   - `MAX_DELAY_MS=5000` - Cap the maximum delay to 5 seconds

2. Modified the update state machine to handle retries:
   - Added `RetryingBroadcast` state to track failed peers and retry count
   - Added retry_count to existing states for consistency
   - Implemented exponential backoff with capped maximum delay

3. Changed error handling for failed broadcasts:
   - Instead of dropping connections on failure, track failed peers for retry
   - Retry broadcasting to failed peers with exponential backoff
   - Only drop connections after maximum retries are exhausted

## Key Features
- **No Slowdown for Happy Path**: The retry logic only activates when broadcasts fail, ensuring that successful updates are not delayed
- **Exponential Backoff**: Delays increase exponentially (BASE_DELAY_MS * 2^retry_count) but are capped at MAX_DELAY_MS
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Added detailed logging of retry attempts and success/failure status

## Testing
The implementation has been tested with the peer blocking tests created in PR #1592 and #1593, which simulate a network where peers are connected through a gateway but not directly to each other.

## Related Issues
This PR addresses the update propagation issues identified in PR #1592 and #1593, where updates fail to propagate reliably between indirectly connected peers.

This PR implements the token counting changes from [PR #54](https://github.com/jina-ai/node-DeepResearch/pull/54), replacing the simplified 1-token-per-message approach with a more accurate character-based estimation.

## Changes
- Replace Vercel's 1-token-per-message with character-based estimation (chars/4)
- Remove token categories (PROMPT, ACCEPTED, REJECTED)
- Add token tracking for content length in read operations
- Add comprehensive tests for token counting

## Implementation Details
- Token estimation: `Math.ceil(Buffer.byteLength(content, 'utf-8') / 4)`
- Removed completion_tokens_details from response
- Added tests for various message lengths and multiple messages
- Updated all tools to use consistent token tracking

## Testing
- Added tests for various message lengths
- Added tests for multiple messages
- Verified token counts match character-based estimation
- Verified token counts increase with message length

This PR addresses an issue where updating workflows via the API failed with an ""MCP error 1003"" because read-only fields (id, createdAt, updatedAt, tags) were included in the request payload. The fix, implemented in `src/api/client.ts` within the `updateWorkflow` method, involves creating a shallow copy of the workflow object and deleting these read-only fields before sending the PUT request.

Findings:
1.  **Code Review:** The changes are correct, targeted, and consistent with existing patterns in `createWorkflow`. The added debug logging is appropriate. The fix directly addresses the root cause.
2.  **Automated Tests:** One test suite (`tests/unit/tools/workflow/simple-tool.test.ts`) failed due to pre-existing TypeScript type errors. These are confirmed to be unrelated to the PR's changes, which were confined to `src/api/client.ts`. The PR author's note about an unrelated test failure aligns with this.
3.  **Manual Verification:** Direct API testing was not possible due to missing environment variables for a test n8n instance. However, code inspection confirmed the filtering logic is correctly implemented as described.
4.  **PR Claims:** The PR successfully resolves the issue described. The solution is sound and aligns with the PR description.

Conclusion:
The PR #23 is approved. The changes effectively fix the `update_workflow` API error by correctly filtering out read-only fields from the payload.

<!-- This is an auto-generated comment: release notes by coderabbit.ai -->

## Summary by CodeRabbit

- **New Features**
  - Introduced a standalone script to manually verify workflow update functionality via the n8n API, including workflow creation, updating, and validation with detailed logging.

- **Bug Fixes**
  - Improved workflow update process to prevent read-only fields from being sent during updates, ensuring smoother and more reliable API interactions.

## Version Type
- CLI Version (npm package)

## Steps to reproduce
1. Install packages using pnpm in a monorepo environment
2. Run build in the `frontend/apps/erd-sample` directory
3. The following warning appears:
```
WARN  Failed to create bin at /vercel/path0/frontend/apps/erd-sample/node_modules/.bin/liam. ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/vercel/path0/frontend/packages/cli/dist-cli/bin/cli.js'
```

## Expected Behavior
The symlink `node_modules/.bin/liam` should be created correctly, and no warning should be displayed.

## Actual Behavior
The creation of the symlink `node_modules/.bin/liam` fails, and a warning is displayed.

## Additional Context
- This issue was discovered during the Vercel deployment of PR #758
- It occurs when using workspace dependencies in a monorepo structure
- In `package.json`, `@liam-hq/cli` is specified as a dependency with `workspace:*`
- The build script directly references `../../packages/cli/dist-cli/bin/cli.js`

**Possible causes:**
1. Build order issue: The erd-sample is being built before the CLI package is built
2. Symlink resolution issue: Workspace dependency symlinks are not being resolved correctly in the Vercel environment

**Possible solutions:**
1. Modify the build script to use the installed package instead of a relative path
2. Review Turborepo dependency settings to explicitly specify the build order
3. Optimize the monorepo build method in Vercel configuration

## Steps to reproduce
1. Run GitHub Actions workflow with both Mobile Safari and Chromium e2e tests
2. Have both test environments fail during the same workflow run
3. Observe the artifact upload process

## Expected Behavior
Both test environments should be able to upload their test results as artifacts, even when they fail simultaneously.

## Actual Behavior
When both Mobile Safari and Chromium tests fail in the same workflow run, the artifact upload fails with a conflict error:
```
Failed to CreateArtifact: Received non-retryable error: Failed request: (409) Conflict: an artifact with this name already exists on the workflow run
```

This was observed in GitHub Actions run: https://github.com/liam-hq/liam/actions/runs/13513200102/job/37757344066?pr=775

## Additional Context
It appears that when both test environments fail, they try to upload artifacts with the same name, causing a conflict. The GitHub Actions workflow needs to be modified to use unique artifact names for each test environment to prevent this conflict."
2877017780,778,Fix Rollup error in initCommand/index.ts: 'const' declarations must be initialized,devin-ai-integration[bot],158243242,closed,2025-02-25T05:21:01Z,2025-02-26T04:51:33Z,https://github.com/liam-hq/liam,https://github.com/liam-hq/liam/issues/778,"## Problem

The Vercel deployment for erd-sample is failing due to a Rollup error in the CLI package build process:

```
RollupError: src/cli/initCommand/index.ts (19:6): 'const' declarations must be initialized
```

This error occurs in the `initCommand/index.ts` file where there's a `const formatMap: Record<string, string>` declaration. Even though the declaration is properly initialized with an object literal in the TypeScript code:

```typescript
const formatMap: Record<string, string> = {
  PostgreSQL: 'postgresql',
  'Ruby on Rails (schema.rb)': 'schemarb',
  // ... more entries
}
```

Rollup is not correctly parsing this TypeScript syntax, leading to a build failure.

## Impact

- The CLI package fails to build, which prevents the erd-sample package from building successfully
- Vercel deployments for erd-sample fail due to this build error

## Possible Solutions

1. Remove the type annotation and let TypeScript infer the type:
   ```typescript
   const formatMap = {
     PostgreSQL: 'postgresql',
     'Ruby on Rails (schema.rb)': 'schemarb',
     // ... more entries
   } as const;
   ```

2. Update the Rollup configuration to better handle TypeScript type annotations

3. Move the type annotation to a separate type declaration:
   ```typescript
   type FormatMap = Record<string, string>;
   const formatMap: FormatMap = {
     // ...
   };
   ```

## Related Issues

This is separate from the TypeScript error in `buildCommand/index.ts` that will be addressed in #768."

2991796651,1336,Add noUnusedImports rule to Biome configuration,MH4GF,31152321,closed,2025-04-14T03:45:32Z,2025-04-14T06:51:06Z,https://github.com/liam-hq/liam,https://github.com/liam-hq/liam/issues/1336,"## Problem

The codebase may contain unused imports which can lead to code bloat, potential bugs, and decreased maintainability. We need to implement the `noUnusedImports` rule from Biome to detect and eliminate these issues.

## Current Behavior

Currently, the linter configuration does not enforce the `noUnusedImports` rule. Developers may inadvertently leave unused imports in files, which can accumulate over time.

## Proposed Solution

Implement the `noUnusedImports` rule in our Biome configuration to automatically detect and flag unused imports. This rule is already available in Biome version 1.9.4 which is currently installed in our project.

## Technical Considerations

- The rule should be set to ""error"" level to ensure it's enforced during linting
- This rule has a ""safe"" fix capability, meaning Biome can automatically remove unused imports
- The rule respects JSX runtime settings and will make an exception for React globals if set to ""reactClassic""
- Implementation should be added to the base configuration to apply across all packages

## Implementation Details

1. Add the `noUnusedImports` rule to the ""correctness"" section in the main Biome configuration file
2. Run Biome check to find and fix existing unused imports across the codebase
3. Document the new rule in our coding standards documentation

3009753036,1433,feat(ui): simplify Lucide icon exports,devin-ai-integration[bot],158243242,closed,2025-04-22T03:26:35Z,2025-04-22T07:23:43Z,https://github.com/liam-hq/liam,https://github.com/liam-hq/liam/pull/1433,"## What does this PR do?
Simplifies Lucide icon exports by removing individual icon files that were only setting strokeWidth={1.5} and directly exporting them from lucide-react in the index.ts file.

## Why are we doing this?
To improve maintainability by leveraging the global strokeWidth CSS rule added in PR #1417 instead of setting it individually in each component.

3024513391,1544,🔥(cleanup): Remove unused Galaxy page files,MH4GF,31152321,closed,2025-04-28T10:40:46Z,2025-04-28T11:05:31Z,https://github.com/liam-hq/liam,https://github.com/liam-hq/liam/pull/1544,"## Issue

- Remove deprecated Galaxy page implementation

## Why is this change needed?
These Galaxy page files are no longer needed and should be removed to keep the codebase clean and prevent confusion. The functionality has likely been migrated elsewhere or is no longer required.

- In PR #1541, notFound() calls were changed to throw statements, which caused build failures as seen in the GitHub Actions run (https://github.com/liam-hq/liam/actions/runs/14705545464)
- These unnecessary files need to be removed to resolve the build issues

## What would you like reviewers to focus on?
- Confirm that the removal doesn't break any existing functionality
- Verify there are no references to these files elsewhere in the codebase

## Testing Verification
Verified that the application continues to function correctly without these files.

## What was done
### 🤖 Generated by PR Agent at e6cf81ee52f0dd94a2972088c760136b761f8b3c

### GitHub Vulnerability Alerts

#### [CVE-2025-46332](https://redirect.github.com/vercel/flags/security/advisories/GHSA-892p-pqrr-hxqr)

## Summary

An information disclosure vulnerability affecting Flags SDK has been addressed. It impacted `flags` ≤3.2.0 and `@vercel/flags` ≤3.1.1 and in certain circumstances, allowed a bad actor with detailed knowledge of the vulnerability to list all flags returned by the flags discovery endpoint (`.well-known/vercel/flags`).

## Impact

This vulnerability allowed for information disclosure, where a bad actor could gain access to a list of all feature flags exposed through the flags discovery endpoint, including the:

- Flag names
- Flag descriptions
- Available options and their labels (e.g. `true`, `false`)
- Default flag values

Not impacted:

- Flags providers were not accessible

No write access nor additional customer data was exposed, this is limited to just the values noted above. Vercel has automatically mitigated this incident on behalf of our customers for the default flags discovery endpoint at `.well-known/vercel/flags`. Flags Explorer will be disabled and show a warning notice until upgraded to `flags@4.0.0`.

## Resolution

The `verifyAccess` function was patched within `flags@4.0.0`. 

Users of `@vercel/flags` should also migrate to `flags@4.0.0`.

For further guidance on upgrading your version, please see our [upgrade guide](https://redirect.github.com/vercel/flags/blob/main/packages/flags/guides/upgrade-to-v4.md).

## Mitigations

Vercel implemented a network-level mitigation to prevent the default flags discovery endpoint at `/.well-known/vercel/flags` being reachable, which automatically protects Vercel deployments against exploitation of this issue. Users need to upgrade to `flags@4.0.0` to re-enable the Flags Explorer.

This automatic mitigation is not effective in two scenarios:

- When using the Flags SDK on Pages Router, as the original non-rewritten route would still be accessible, e.g. `/api/vercel/flags`.
- When using a custom path for the flags discovery endpoint.

If you are not protected by the Vercel default mitigation you can temporarily deny access to the other exposed flags discovery endpoints through a custom WAF rule while you upgrade to the latest version.

### [`v8.0.0`](https://redirect.github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/blob/HEAD/release-notes.md#800)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/compare/7.0.0...v8.0.0)

-   [#&#8203;580](https://redirect.github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/580) **Multiple tweaks to `diffSentences`**:
    -   tokenization no longer takes quadratic time on pathological inputs (reported as a ReDOS vulnerability by Snyk); is now linear instead
    -   the final sentence in the string is now handled the same by the tokenizer regardless of whether it has a trailing punctuation mark or not. (Previously, ""foo. bar."" tokenized to `[""foo."", "" "", ""bar.""]` but ""foo. bar"" tokenized to `[""foo."", "" bar""]` - i.e. whether the space between sentences was treated as a separate token depended upon whether the final sentence had trailing punctuation or not. This was arbitrary and surprising; it is no longer the case.)
    -   in a string that starts with a sentence end, like ""! hello."", the ""!"" is now treated as a separate sentence
    -   the README now correctly documents the tokenization behaviour (it was wrong before)
-   [#&#8203;581](https://redirect.github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/581) - **fixed some regex operations used for tokenization in `diffWords` taking O(n^2) time** in pathological cases
-   [#&#8203;595](https://redirect.github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/595) - **fixed a crash in patch creation functions when handling a single hunk consisting of a very large number (e.g. >130k) of lines**. (This was caused by spreading indefinitely-large arrays to `.push()` using `.apply` or the spread operator and hitting the JS-implementation-specific limit on the maximum number of arguments to a function, as shown at https://stackoverflow.com/a/56809779/1709587; thus the exact threshold to hit the error will depend on the environment in which you were running JsDiff.)
-   [#&#8203;596](https://redirect.github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/596) - **removed the `merge` function**. Previously JsDiff included an undocumented function called `merge` that was meant to, in some sense, merge patches. It had at least a couple of serious bugs that could lead to it returning unambiguously wrong results, and it was difficult to simply ""fix"" because it was [unclear precisely what it was meant to do](https://redirect.github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/issues/181#issuecomment-2198319542). For now, the fix is to remove it entirely.
-   [#&#8203;591](https://redirect.github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/591) - JsDiff's source code has been rewritten in TypeScript. This change entails the following changes for end users:
    -   **the `diff` package on npm now includes its own TypeScript type definitions**. Users who previously used the `@types/diff` npm package from DefinitelyTyped should remove that dependency when upgrading JsDiff to v8.

        Note that the transition from the DefinitelyTyped types to JsDiff's own type definitions includes multiple fixes and also removes many exported types previously used for `options` arguments to diffing and patch-generation functions. (There are now different exported options types for abortable calls - ones with a `timeout` or `maxEditLength` that may give a result of `undefined` - and non-abortable calls.) See the TypeScript section of the README for some usage tips.

    -   **The `Diff` object is now a class**. Custom extensions of `Diff`, as described in the ""Defining custom diffing behaviors"" section of the README, can therefore now be done by writing a `class CustomDiff extends Diff` and overriding methods, instead of the old way based on prototype inheritance. (I *think* code that did things the old way should still work, though!)

    -   **`diff/lib/index.es6.js` and `diff/lib/index.mjs` no longer exist, and the ESM version of the library is no longer bundled into a single file.**

    -   **The `ignoreWhitespace` option for `diffWords` is no longer included in the type declarations**. The effect of passing `ignoreWhitespace: true` has always been to make `diffWords` just call `diffWordsWithSpace` instead, which was confusing, because that behaviour doesn't seem properly described as ""ignoring"" whitespace at all. The property remains available to non-TypeScript applications for the sake of backwards compatability, but TypeScript applications will now see a type error if they try to pass `ignoreWhitespace: true` to `diffWords` and should change their code to call `diffWordsWithSpace` instead.

    -   JsDiff no longer purports to support ES3 environments. (I'm pretty sure it never truly did, despite claiming to in its README, since even the 1.0.0 release used `Array.map` which was added in ES5.)
-   [#&#8203;601](https://redirect.github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/601) - **`diffJson`'s `stringifyReplacer` option behaves more like `JSON.stringify`'s `replacer` argument now.** In particular:
    -   Each key/value pair now gets passed through the replacer once instead of twice
    -   The `key` passed to the replacer when the top-level object is passed in as `value` is now `""""` (previously, was `undefined`), and the `key` passed with an array element is the array index as a string, like `""0""` or `""1""` (previously was whatever the key for the entire array was). Both the new behaviours match that of `JSON.stringify`.
-   [#&#8203;602](https://redirect.github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/602) - **diffing functions now consistently return `undefined` when called in async mode** (i.e. with a callback). Previously, there was an odd quirk where they would return `true` if the strings being diffed were equal and `undefined` otherwise.

### Version (only for Self Hosted)

_No response_

### Steps to reproduce




1. Run the following command with a non-existent file path:

   ```bash
   npx @liam-hq/cli erd build --input no-such-path.sql --format postgres
   ```
2. Observe the output



### Expected Behavior

Only the following error message should be printed in a clean, user-friendly way:

```
No files found matching the pattern. Please provide valid file(s).
```

### Actual Behavior

A full stack trace is printed unnecessarily, which may overwhelm users and obscure the root issue:

```

3116803064,1878,feat: move @liam-hq/jobs package to internal-packages,devin-ai-integration[bot],158243242,closed,2025-06-04T07:28:41Z,2025-06-05T01:46:31Z,https://github.com/liam-hq/liam,https://github.com/liam-hq/liam/pull/1878,"# Move @liam-hq/jobs package to internal-packages

This PR moves the `@liam-hq/jobs` package from `frontend/packages` to `frontend/internal-packages` as part of the effort to separate public-facing packages from internal packages.

## Changes Made

- ✅ Moved `frontend/packages/jobs` → `frontend/internal-packages/jobs`
- ✅ Updated postinstall script path to reference correct db-structure location
- ✅ Updated workspace dependencies in `pnpm-lock.yaml`
- ✅ All workspace references resolve correctly
- ✅ Package builds and dependencies work correctly

## Package Classification

The `@liam-hq/jobs` package is correctly classified as internal because:
- It has `""private"": true` in package.json
- It has `""access"": ""restricted""` in publishConfig
- It's used internally for Trigger.dev background job workflows
- It's not intended for public consumption

## Dependencies

This package depends on other internal packages:
- `@liam-hq/db` (already in internal-packages)
- `@liam-hq/github` (moved in previous PR #1871)

## Testing

- ✅ `pnpm install` completes successfully
- ✅ Workspace dependencies resolve correctly
- ✅ Postinstall script executes without errors
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Related

- Issue: #1077 - separate `frontend/packages/*` directory to `frontend/internal-packages`
- Previous PR: #1871 - Move @liam-hq/github package to internal-packages
- Link to Devin run: https://app.devin.ai/sessions/c83198db07b14e8f9f32441b2e16c829

This is the second package in the migration plan. Remaining packages to move:
- `e2e` (private)
- `__mocks__` (private)

Public packages (`cli`, `db-structure`, `erd-core`, `ui`) will remain in `frontend/packages`.

This PR completes the final cleanup for issue #1077 by removing the unused `node-gtts` package and its references from the workspace configuration.

## Changes Made

### Package Deletion
- ✅ Deleted unused `node-gtts` package from `frontend/packages/__mocks__/node-gtts`
- ✅ Removed `""node-gtts"": ""workspace:*""` override from root package.json
- ✅ Removed `node-gtts` from changeset ignore list in `.changeset/config.json`

## Cleanup Details

The `node-gtts` package was identified as completely unused:
- No imports or references found in the codebase
- Only existed as a workspace override in package.json
- Was the only content in the `__mocks__` directory
- Safely removed without affecting any functionality

## Testing

- ✅ `pnpm install` completes successfully
- ✅ Workspace dependencies resolve correctly (16 projects, down from 17)
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
- ✅ All lint checks pass

## Migration Completion

This PR completes the package migration initiative:
- ✅ #1871 - Move @liam-hq/github package to internal-packages
- ✅ #1878 - Move @liam-hq/jobs package to internal-packages  
- ✅ #1884 - Move @liam-hq/e2e package to internal-packages
- ✅ **This PR** - Delete unused node-gtts package and cleanup

**Final State:**
- **Public packages** (remain in `frontend/packages/`): `cli`, `db-structure`, `erd-core`, `ui`
- **Internal packages** (moved to `frontend/internal-packages/`): `configs`, `db`, `figma-to-css-variables`, `mcp-server`, `storybook`, `github`, `jobs`, `e2e`

The `__mocks__` directory contained only the unused `node-gtts` package, so it was completely removed rather than migrated.

## Issue
The PHP packagist publishing workflow was failing with the error ""No composer.json was found in the main branch"" because Packagist requires composer.json to be at the repository root, but our PHP SDK is in a subdirectory (php/sdk/).

## Fix
- Added the monorepo-split-github-action to create a separate repository just for the PHP SDK
- Modified the packagist-publish.php script to use the split repository URL
- Added environment variable support for the repository URL

## Testing
The fix should be verified when the workflow runs on the next push to main that affects the PHP SDK.

3126377317,863,bug: template substitution fails when translation has different element count (destructive shift() bug),eugene-yaroslavtsev,44253687,closed,2025-06-07T03:34:52Z,2025-06-10T19:58:56Z,https://github.com/lingodotdev/lingo.dev,https://github.com/lingodotdev/lingo.dev/issues/863,"### Description

The lingo.dev localization system experiences rendering failures when template placeholder counts differ between locales. The Japanese locale specifically renders as ""ビルド。<element:"" with raw template syntax visible in production.

### Screenshot

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2e19bf7-0f83-4116-9816-0910e4a88dad)

### Root Cause

The template substitution logic in [packages/react/src/core/component.tsx:157](https://github.com/lingodotdev/lingo.dev/blob/f0c939c68580151af8c89296350b29119441f964/packages/react/src/core/component.tsx#L157) uses destructive array consumption:

```typescript
const Element = elements?.shift();
```

This approach creates an implicit dependency between placeholder matching order and element availability. When translations contain different numbers of placeholders than the source template, the elements array becomes exhausted, causing subsequent placeholders to pass through unprocessed.

### Claude Artifact Demo

https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/ef544a7c-1cb0-4a0f-826d-ce34c3eaa58b

### Technical Analysis

The current implementation exhibits several architectural challenges:

1. **State Mutation** - Using `shift()` destroys the original array, making post-failure debugging difficult
2. **Silent Failure** - Missing elements result in raw template syntax rather than build errors
3. **Order Dependency** - Template processing depends on runtime matching order rather than structural validation

### Reproduction

Simple test case demonstrating the issue:
```javascript
// Template with 2 placeholders, but only 1 element provided
template: ""ビルド。<element:el>コミット</element:el>。<element:el>翻訳</element:el>。""
elements: [""strong""]
// Result: ""ビルド。<strong>コミット</strong>。<element:el>翻訳</element:el>。""
```

### Proposed Solution

The pragmatic fix involves two changes:

1. **Immediate: Use index-based element access**
```typescript
let elementIndex = 0;
const Element = elements?.[elementIndex++];
```

2. **Proper: Add build-time validation**
```typescript
function validateTemplate(template: string, elements: unknown[]): void {
  const placeholderCount = (template.match(/<element:\w+>/g) || []).length;
  if (placeholderCount !== elements.length) {
    throw new Error(
      `Template validation failed: ${placeholderCount} placeholders, ${elements.length} elements`
    );
  }
}
```

### Impact

This pattern affects any locale where translators adjust the number of emphasized elements to match their language's natural structure. Since grammatical emphasis varies significantly between languages, this is a common scenario in localization.

The fix is straightforward and improves both reliability and debuggability. By validating at build time and using immutable data access patterns, we can catch template mismatches before they reach production while maintaining clear execution traces for debugging.

### Additional Context

This represents a common tradeoff in system design: the current implementation optimizes for code brevity at the expense of robustness. In localization systems, where template variations are the norm rather than the exception, favoring predictability and clear failure modes yields better long-term outcomes."

I have a `altair.Chart()` which outputs fine if I render it directly but if I wrap it in a `mo.ui.altair_chart()` then the string x-axis values which are versions of the form ""x.y.x"" are getting evaluated as datetimes so the graph is exactly the same except the x-values are erroneously shown as datetimes. See next image. First graph is raw altair graph, second is wrapped graph.

Group By Transform in `mo.ui.dataframe(df)` does not return valid Polars code.

Details in example below. It is pretty easy to see what is going wrong.

### Environment

<details>

In WASM, so unsure how to run `marimo env`
Instead, here are the package versions I am using
```
marimo.__version__: ""0.10.8-dev3""
polars.__version__: ""1.18.0""
```

</details>


### Code to reproduce

```python
import marimo as mo
import polars as pl

df = pl.DataFrame({""group"": [""a"", ""a"", ""b""], ""age"": [10, 11, 12]})
mo.ui.dataframe(df)
```

This Transform
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/52941dcf-5a37-44ff-adb1-05c3e69231c4)

Produces this Polars code
```python
df_next = df
df_next = df_next.group_by([""group""], maintain_order=True).agg([pl.col(""age_max"").max().alias(""age_max_max"")])
```
which raises `polars.exceptions.ColumnNotFoundError: age_max`


The correct Polars code (with no other stylistic adjustments) would be
```python
df_next = df
df_next = df_next.group_by([""group""], maintain_order=True).agg([pl.col(""age"").max().alias(""age_max"")])

We are using Ibis and the Databricks Connect (Spark Connect) backend to run queries over large datasets. 

However, if I mess up a query and try cancelling it using the ""Stop (interrupt) execution"" button, then marimo will register the interruption request:

```plain

STDERR
(cell-12)
[34m[D 250118 10:59:06 handlers:25](B[m Interrupt request received
```

but then just continue waiting forever (even after the query is finished in Databricks).

If I hit push the ""Stop (interrupt) execution"" button twice the exception will be raised and I get the following trace:

I have a widget that needs to wide and tall and be displayed alongside my code as I scroll down the notebook.
I thought I could put the widget in a sidebar so it's always visible and out of the way of my code, but the width of the sidebar is just too narrow to properly see the widget.

### Suggested solution

I think it'd be good to have a default width parameter to the sidebar layout, as well as a boolean flag to make the width adjustable by dragging the divider.

### Alternative

I've tried looking at the CSS to see if I can adjust it from within my widget to accomplish my goals, but I'm not skilled enough to figure it out apparently.

### Additional context

Widget needs to be wider:

Suppose I have a postgres query which takes some time to run.

After 01:30, the minute counter is incremented.  01:28, 01:29, 02:30, 02:31, and so on.
The minute counter is incremented at the wrong time.

Other than the wrong execution time, marimo itself works fine.

I came across an error, where some marimo tools that I created were not running, due to a defected recent_files.toml file. 
I'm not sure what caused the file to be bad, and already removed it, but I do know that the code around line 37 in marimo/_utils/config/config.py tries to parse this file and only handles FileNotFoundError - it does not handle parsing errors, and apparently they happen.

In dark mode, everything accessed by a dot like methods or objects from modules have the same color as variables which isn't the case in light mode. Maybe it's just the theme marimo uses but it would be nice if the color is different which is the case in light mode as it makes the code more readable.

Hi,

I would like an input please - an input that allows one to rapidly select one option from a long-ish list of possible strings. (I think only strings would make sense for this?) Currently I am using the dropdown, which does not seem the fastest for long lists.

What I'm imagining is something that is functionally like a dropdown input (in the sense that only a fixed list of options are allowable), but visually like a text input: one would type into it, and it would autocomplete among the options.

Is there already a way of choosing quickly from a high-cardinality set of options? Apologies if I've missed that. Would be glad to hear your thoughts on this idea please!

Many thanks,
Tom

p.s. thinking about it, this feature could be extended to support other features of autocomplete libraries, e.g. multi-selects. But in the first instance I would love a single-selection one of these please :)

### Suggested solution

I don't want to be prescriptive about details, but I would imagine that there are commonly-used autocomplete libraries compatible with the front-end stack of Marimo, and it would be a case of integrating one of those into either a new Input, or as an option into an existing one like dropdown.

2893925408,3971,AI chat/generation shows false error when streaming response.,KristianSchmidt,8388147,closed,2025-03-04T11:27:57Z,2025-03-04T23:06:57Z,https://github.com/marimo-team/marimo,https://github.com/marimo-team/marimo/issues/3971,"### Describe the bug

## The problem
I am trying to use the Marimo AI features with an OpenAI compatible API. It's actually OpenAI under the hood, but you connect via an internal endpoint.
So I change the base url to this, and it works, but each time I make a request, I get this exception in the console
```
File ""[my local repository]\.venv\Lib\site-packages\marimo\_server\api\endpoints\ai.py"", line 175, in get_content
    return response.choices[0].delta.content  # type: ignore
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'content'
```
In this UI it looks like this:

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47f3d135-fdf3-4193-9324-f0b9f30e6165)

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d058d7c-a93c-40cd-abbf-1cb8f8d01ccb)

So it _works_, but it shows an error anyway. Which stems from the fact that when streaming the response, there's a single message chunk that looks like this
```
{""id"":"""",""choices"":[{""delta"":null,""finish_reason"":null,""index"":0,""logprobs"":null,""content_filter_offsets"":{""check_offset"":520,""start_offset"":520,""end_offset"":607},""content_filter_results"":{""hate"":{""filtered"":false,""severity"":""safe""},""self_harm"":{""filtered"":false,""severity"":""safe""},""sexual"":{""filtered"":false,""severity"":""safe""},""violence"":{""filtered"":false,""severity"":""safe""}}}],""created"":0,""model"":"""",""object"":"""",""service_tier"":null,""system_fingerprint"":null,""usage"":
null}\n\n'
```

I am unsure if this is present when streaming from the official OpenAI API as well. So the problem arises when we look at line 174-175 of `ai.py`

```
if hasattr(response, ""choices"") and response.choices:
    return response.choices[0].delta.content  # type: ignore
```
There's a check for the existence and non-emptiness of `choices`, but in this case the `delta` inside the first choice is None.

## The fix
I managed to fix this by modifying line 174:
```
if hasattr(response, ""choices"") and response.choices and response.choices[0].delta:
```
Which seems pretty benign to include, even if this extra message isn't present in the official OpenAI API. So I hope you will consider fixing this :)

In general, we probably should also remove the generic because it's not possible to really know at runtime what input you could receive on a given bot. Our examples do not provide any indication that this is the case and neither do our types, so this is probably something that could come back to bite Medplum users later, especially in the cases of their own users fuzz testing inputs.

The recommendation:
1. Add `undefined` to the type union
2. Remove generic (or only add it to the union itself instead of overriding it), put the union directly on the `input` field of `BotEvent`"

All crawl requests are failing with supabase connection error on self-host instance, even though that the flag for USE_DB_AUTHENTICATION is set to false.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the issue:
1. Deploy the stack using portainer configured with the public repository to fetch and build the application;
2. Call the crawl API with any URL or parameters;

**Expected Behavior**
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen when self-hosting.

Expected behaviour, once we set on the environment variables that USE_DB_AUTHENTICATION = FALSE, we expect that the application in its whole respects the configuration. I'm not sure exactly what is happening, but 100% of the attempts fail with the same error.

I managed to get some working on my first setup of firecrawl, but for some reason after a few attempts, all requests started to fail with the same error.

**Screenshots**
If applicable, add screenshots or copies of the command line output to help explain the self-hosting issue.

2980501336,1426,[Bug] Map results include extra links,sawyerclemmons,33075282,closed,2025-04-08T17:34:40Z,2025-06-20T22:34:50Z,https://github.com/mendableai/firecrawl,https://github.com/mendableai/firecrawl/issues/1426,"**Describe the Bug**
When using the Firecrawl API and calling the map endpoint, some extra urls are sometimes included in the results. This seems to happen when calling the map endpoint for a child url that does not exist and then later calling it again for the parent url.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the issue:
1. Call the `/map` endpoint for a site such as 
```
curl --location 'https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/map' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer ***' \
--data '{
    ""url"": ""https://faculty.cs.byu.edu/~rodham/cs240""
}'
```
The results do not include the url `https://faculty.cs.byu.edu/~rodham/cs240/this-path-is-invalid`

2. Call the` /map` endpoint with a child url that does not exist and resolves to a 404
```
curl --location 'https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/map' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer ***' \
--data '{
    ""url"": ""https://faculty.cs.byu.edu/~rodham/cs240/this-path-is-invalid""
}'
```
This returns a map result with just the provided page as it's not a valid path and leads to a forbidden page.

3. Call the `/map` endpoint for the parent url again.
```
curl --location 'https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/map' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer ***' \
--data '{
    ""url"": ""https://faculty.cs.byu.edu/~rodham/cs240""
}'
```
Now the results do include the url `https://faculty.cs.byu.edu/~rodham/cs240/this-path-is-invalid`

**Expected Behavior**
These non-existent paths would not be included in the map results.

I've been testing this API for work for a few weeks and im writing a tool to collect llms full texts for each of our products and services so they can be placed at ../../product1/llmstext and so on

There are 6 urls that i pass into the function.

And i've been doing a few runs of this but noticed that ALL 12 docs (i get llms text and full text for each of the 6 urls) are only relating to the one url -- say product https://github.com/hellofirecrawl/docs/issues/5 in this example.

the other products arent showing up.

what is the cache eviction policy? is there any way to flush the cache?

Thanks!

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the issue:
You can also see the issue arise when using the demo tool: https://llmstxt.firecrawl.dev/
After 4 runs, the responses are identical regardless of what URL sub domain is passed in, as long as the main domain is the same.  

This indicates a caching issue.

**Expected Behavior**
Each run with a URL should be returning the parsed content from that URL alone.

If applicable, add screenshots or copies of the command line output to help explain the issue.

Fixes #1513, #1469, #1466

## Description
This PR adds conditional checks before making Supabase calls in queue-worker.ts to prevent connection errors when USE_DB_AUTHENTICATION is false.

## Changes
- Added a condition check in finishCrawlIfNeeded before retrieving lastUrls from Supabase
- Added a condition check in the indexing code to only queue indexing jobs when USE_DB_AUTHENTICATION is true
- Added a test to verify functionality when USE_DB_AUTHENTICATION is false

The bug was that even with USE_DB_AUTHENTICATION=false, the code was still trying to call Supabase, causing connection errors in self-hosted instances.

Note: This PR implements the same changes as PR #1429, which was closed due to inactivity.

- o3 and o4-mini: Reasoning models similar to the existing o3-mini model
- gpt-4.1: Non-reasoning model similar to gpt-4o

## Google:
- gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25
- gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17

## Implementation Details:
- Added the new models to the model token limits dictionary
- Added the new models to the model selection dropdowns
- Updated reasoning model checks to include o3 and o4-mini
- Implemented ""thinking"" functionality for Google Gemini 2.5 models
- Added UI elements to display thinking content for Gemini models

## Testing:
- API keys will be needed for testing the actual API calls

2932594459,13162,[Log] Fix confusing block sync logs while state sync is in place,walnut-the-cat,122475853,closed,2025-03-19T17:21:22Z,2025-03-26T15:36:07Z,https://github.com/near/nearcore,https://github.com/near/nearcore/issues/13162,"There has been multiple complaints from validators who are confused with following log messages appearing during state sync:

`Downloading blocks 0.00%`

While a node is going through syncing processes that are required before block sync (e.g. epoch sync, state sync), it seems that the log message above is printed. 

Technically, it makes sense as no block will be downloaded until all the necessary steps are done, but from user perspective, it's confusing and they end up suspecting the node is stuck.

We want to do better handling of this message, by either updating the text, or simply hiding the message until block sync actually starts."

Historically, we included resident size as a billing metric.  This is not actually used in billing, but was consumed by some other systems (admin console https://github.com/neondatabase/cloud/issues/15821, and some business analytics).

It has been inaccurate since we rolled out sharding, since it only reflects the resident size of shard zero.

This PR adds the `--dev` CLI flag to both the pageserver and safekeeper binaries without implementing any functionality yet. This is a precursor to PR #11517, which will implement the full functionality to require authentication by default unless the `--dev` flag is specified.

3063509475,8304,feat(dashboard): add automatic redirects from direct URLs to environment-specific URLs,devin-ai-integration[bot],158243242,closed,2025-05-14T15:25:14Z,2025-05-14T15:48:46Z,https://github.com/novuhq/novu,https://github.com/novuhq/novu/pull/8304,"# Automatic Redirects from Direct URLs to Environment-Specific URLs

## Description
This PR implements automatic redirects from direct URLs like ""/topics"" to environment-specific URLs like ""/env/:envId/topics"". This makes external linking easier by allowing users to share direct URLs without the environment ID in the slug.

## Changes
- Created a new `RedirectToEnvironment` component that handles redirects from direct URLs to environment-specific URLs
- Added routes in `main.tsx` for direct URLs like ""/topics"", ""/workflows"", etc.
- Implemented redirect logic using the `useEnvironment` hook to get the current environment
- Ensured query parameters and hash are preserved during redirects

## Testing
- Tested locally by navigating to direct URLs like ""/topics"" and ""/workflows""
- Verified redirects work correctly and maintain functionality
- Confirmed query parameters and hash are preserved during redirects

3. wait a week (or change the timestamps somehow)
4. go to Activity feed, 24 h shows fine
5. Change timeframe to 7 days or more
6. 502 error happens
7. API container throws TypeError as below 

### 👍 Expected behavior

**Expected:**
Activity feed range for self-hosted Novu should return all ranged without licensing restrictions. 
If such restrictions were in place - the FE should not throw 502 errors and spike both CPU and RAM



### 👎 Actual Behavior with Screenshots

**Actual:**
Dashboard gets 502, retries several times then shows pop-up:
`Fetch error: Unexpected token '<', ""<html> <h""... is not valid JSON`

In actuality - API container registers multiple (due to retries) instances of below errors:
`TypeError: Cannot use 'in' operator to search for 'message' in Requested date range exceeds your plan's retention period. The earliest accessible date for your plan is 2025-06-15. Please upgrade your plan to access older activities.`

it just run the app without actually saving the access token, letting you stuck on initial page.

From [electron docs](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/launch-app-from-url-in-another-app#windows-and-linux-code) it seems the code to handle this in linux should be the same as Windows.

```js

When using the Onlook MacOS app, entering Japanese text into the prompt field is problematic. Specifically, after typing Japanese characters and pressing the Enter key to confirm the conversion, the prompt is immediately submitted. This behavior prevents proper Japanese text input, as users cannot complete their intended message before it is sent.

# Steps to Reproduce

1. Open the Onlook app on MacOS.
2. Begin typing in Japanese in the prompt input field (e.g., using the macOS Japanese IME).
3. Press the Enter key to confirm the conversion of kanji or other characters.

# Expected Behavior
Pressing Enter should confirm the text conversion without submitting the prompt. Users should be able to continue editing their message before choosing to submit it.

# Actual Behavior
The prompt is automatically submitted upon pressing Enter, even when the user intends only to confirm the text conversion.

# Environment
App Version: 0.1.28
OS Version: macOS 15.2（24C101）
Input Method: macOS Japanese IME and ATOK IME

Continuation of https://github.com/onlook-dev/onlook/issues/1063
Currently, the UI is built and hidden on the LayersPanel side

1. The image tab should scan for the standard Next.js assets folder and find any images that can be used. 
2. The images should be loaded into the sidepanel
3. Allow the ability to add image which will put it in the expected next.js standard folder
4. Add a search bar that just filters based on filename

Optional (can be separate PR)
1. Renaming the image should rename it but also find usage instance and refactor those as well
2. Support dragging the image into the frame which should add it to the target div's background, similar to the fill effect in the styles Panel

Because I've created a staticSchema that goes with the table when another page is generated, the lack of head on table repetitions leaves it a little confusing.

A boolean parameter that defines if the head will be repeated or not

The local references in packages introduced [here](https://github.com/pdfme/pdfme/commit/9ecd6346a625402d871661f2b413d54fa1e6bd3d) break the installation in pnpm:

```shell
ERR_PNPM_LINKED_PKG_DIR_NOT_FOUND
```

Affected versions: `>=5.3.12`


### To Reproduce

The repro uses pnpm workspaces so StackBlitz auto-detects pnpm. The included example package as a standalone would throw the exact same error so this bug is not related to pnpm workspaces but pnpm in general:

[StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/pdfme-pnpm-repro)

- Operating system: MacOS
- Node.js version or Browser name & version: 22

I have a test suite with 50 tests in my CSV file. I want to split them by topic manually and run only some of them.

**Describe the solution you'd like**  
Add a `__metadata:topic` column that would result in the value being put into the test's metadata, by which I can filter via `--filter-metadata`.

Note that some tests might cover 2 or more topics. In this case, I'd like to be able to put 2 values to the same metadata key as an array. For this, I propose a special column name convention: `__metadata:*[]`, e.g. `__metadata:topic[]`. In this case, the value should be split by `"",""` (with the ability to escape like this: `""\,""`).

**Describe alternatives you've considered**  
I'll probably use `--filter-pattern` as a workaround and put tags into the description. But this is brittle for larger test suites.

**Additional context**  
Even being able to do smth like `__metadata:topic` would be super-helpful. Being able to pass arrays is a cherry on top. "

This PR introduces unit tests for the `generateTable` and `wrapTable` functions in the `table` module. Key highlights include:



- **`generateTable` Tests**:

  - Validates table generation with correct headers and data.

  - Ensures proper handling of failed test cases, including formatting with `chalk` for failure messages.

  - Tests the `maxRows` parameter to limit the number of rows displayed.

  - Verifies truncation of long cell content to respect column width constraints.



- **`wrapTable` Tests**:

  - Confirms correct wrapping of data into table format with appropriate column widths.

  - Handles edge cases, such as empty data, returning a ""No data to display"" message.



- **Mocking**:

  - Mocks `cli-table3` to isolate and test the logic of the table generation functions without relying on external dependencies.



These tests ensure robust functionality and edge case handling for table rendering in the CLI.

- **Basic Rendering Tests**:

  - Verifies the default rendering of an empty intent input.

  - Confirms rendering of existing intents from the configuration.



- **Functionality Tests**:

  - Tests adding new intents and removing existing ones.

  - Validates CSV file upload functionality for bulk intent addition.

  - Ensures pagination is displayed when intents exceed the `ITEMS_PER_PAGE` limit.

  - Confirms updates to plugins when intents are modified.



- **Edge Case Handling**:

  - Ensures the delete button is disabled when only one intent remains.

  - Disables the add button when there are empty intents in the list.

N/A - Not related to local development.

### Summary

https://appkit-lab.reown.com/library/solana/


I am developing a mobile wallet and want to verify the integration using the AppKit-Lab tool as per the instructions:


2. Open [appkit-lab.reown.com](https://appkit-lab.reown.com/) on a mobile browser.
3. Select Solana default.
4. Click Custom Wallet and enter the wallet details:

- Name: oblio
- Image URL: https://oblio.network/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/cropped-Icon-02.png
- Deep Link: oblio://
8. Click Connect Wallet.

**Expected Behavior:**
The custom wallet oblio should appear in the list of wallets, allowing me to test the deep link (oblio://) integration.

**Actual Behavior:**
The custom wallet oblio does not appear in the wallet list under the Solana section.
However, the same steps work as expected in the feature default, where the wallet is displayed and functional.

Could you please confirm if the Solana integration in the AppKit-Lab tool is functioning correctly or if additional setup is required?

Thank you!

```ts
import alchemy from ""alchemy"";

const db = await alchemy(""db"", options);

export const neon = await NeonProject(""neon"", {
  name: ""bmarks"",

await db.finalize();
```

Then, add `pg_version: 17` (since it defaults to 16 in #122):

```diff
  name: ""bmarks"",
+ pg_version: 17,
```

So, there are a few things to address IMO:

1. **Don't** default `pg_version` – the REST API already defaults this (https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createproject), so Alchemy will be perpetually behind.
2. `pg_version` can't be updated in an existing project via the REST API (https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/updateproject) or the GUI.  (Makes sense, because this would require migrating DBs)

    I would've expected an error from Neon for this, triggering an update failure in Alchemy. (Where the developer would say ""Oops, my bad!"" and remove that line)

	_Or_, Neon isn't very strict with their API (which is true – `name` doesn't have to be unique!?).  So at the very least **Alchemy should return a valid `NeonProject` resource still since there's not an error**."

This PR implements the Cloudflare Version Metadata binding for Alchemy, following the pattern established in PR #239 (Images binding).

## Changes Made

- **Added `VersionMetadata` class** (`alchemy/src/cloudflare/version-metadata.ts`) - Simple binding class with `type = ""version_metadata""`
- **Updated type definitions** in `bindings.ts` to include `VersionMetadata` in the `Binding` union type
- **Updated bound type mapping** in `bound.ts` to map `VersionMetadata` to `Fetcher`
- **Added worker metadata handling** in `worker-metadata.ts` to process version metadata bindings
- **Added wrangler.json support** in `wrangler.json.ts` with no-op handling (similar to ai_gateway)
- **Exported from index** to make `VersionMetadata` available to consumers
- **Added comprehensive test** that creates a worker with version metadata binding and verifies it works

## Implementation Details

The Version Metadata binding provides access to worker version information (version ID, tag, and timestamp) at runtime. It follows the same minimal pattern as other simple bindings like `BrowserRendering` and `Images`:

- Simple class with just a `type` property
- No configuration required
- Maps to `Fetcher` in the runtime binding type
- Handled as no-op in wrangler.json (version metadata is automatically available)

## Testing

- ✅ All lint checks pass (`bun check`)
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ Test file created following existing patterns
- ⚠️ Integration test requires Cloudflare authentication (expected for CI environment)

## References

- Fixes #237
- Follows pattern from PR #239 (Images binding)
- Related to #236

This PR fixes the incorrect type mapping for Cloudflare Version Metadata binding in `bound.ts`.

## Problem

The previous implementation in PR #240 incorrectly mapped `VersionMetadata` to `Fetcher` in the `Bound` type, but according to the [Cloudflare documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/version-metadata/), version metadata provides an object with `id`, `tag`, and `timestamp` properties.

## Solution

- **Added `VersionMetadataRuntime` interface** with the correct structure:
  - `id: string` - Version ID
  - `tag: string` - Version tag  
  - `timestamp: string` - Timestamp when the version was created
- **Updated type mapping** in `bound.ts` to map `VersionMetadata` to `VersionMetadataRuntime` instead of `Fetcher`

## Changes Made

- `alchemy/src/cloudflare/bound.ts`:
  - Added `VersionMetadataRuntime` interface with proper JSDoc documentation
  - Updated the `Bound` type mapping from `Fetcher` to `VersionMetadataRuntime`

## Testing

- ✅ All lint checks pass (`bun check`)
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful

## References

- Fixes the type mapping issue from PR #240
- Follows [Cloudflare Version Metadata documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/version-metadata/)

## 変更内容
`get_bone_name`関数のキャッシュ実装を簡素化し、クロスプラットフォーム互換性を向上させました。具体的には以下の変更を行いました：

1. 複雑な二次キャッシュ機構を削除
2. キャッシュに古い値が見つかった場合、キャッシュ全体をクリアするのではなく、その特定のエントリのみを削除する実装は維持

3115627844,1053,Fix ReDoS vulnerability in private key regex pattern,devin-ai-integration[bot],158243242,closed,2025-06-03T22:39:28Z,2025-06-03T22:43:26Z,https://github.com/secretlint/secretlint,https://github.com/secretlint/secretlint/pull/1053,"# Fix ReDoS vulnerability in private key regex pattern

## Problem
The current regex pattern in `secretlint-rule-privatekey` contains a vulnerability that can cause polynomial time complexity (ReDoS - Regular Expression Denial of Service) when processing strings with many repetitions of ""-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----"" markers.

The problematic pattern `[\s\S][\s\S]*?` can cause catastrophic backtracking even with non-greedy matching when the regex engine encounters multiple BEGIN markers without corresponding END markers.

## Solution
Replace the vulnerable pattern with a length-constrained version:

**Before:**
```javascript
/-----BEGIN\s?((?:DSA|RSA|EC|PGP|OPENSSH|[A-Z]{2,16})?\s?PRIVATE KEY(\sBLOCK)?)-----[\s\S][\s\S]*?-----END\s?\1-----/gm
```

**After:**
```javascript
/-----BEGIN\s?((?:DSA|RSA|EC|PGP|OPENSSH|[A-Z]{2,16})?\s?PRIVATE KEY(\sBLOCK)?)-----[\s\S]{1,10000}?-----END\s?\1-----/gm
```

## Research and Rationale

### Private Key Length Analysis
- **RSA test case**: 886 characters
- **RSA-4096 test case**: 3,388 characters (largest in test suite)
- **ECDSA-256 test case**: 512 characters

### Cryptographic Standards
- NIST recommends RSA minimum 2048-bit, maximum practical 4096-bit
- Research shows 4096-bit RSA keys are the realistic maximum for production use
- 10,000 character limit provides generous safety margin above largest observed key (3,388 chars)

### Security Impact
- **Prevents ReDoS attacks** by limiting regex backtracking search space
- **Maintains detection accuracy** - all existing test cases remain within the 10,000 character limit
- **Conservative approach** - limit is 3x larger than biggest test case

## Testing
- All existing snapshot tests (RSA, RSA-4096, ECDSA-256) remain within the new limit
- The fix directly addresses the polynomial time vulnerability without changing detection logic
- No functional changes to the rule behavior for legitimate private keys

## References
- [NIST Key Size Recommendations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_size#Asymmetric_algorithm_key_lengths)
- [RFC 7468 - Textual Encodings of PKIX, PKCS, and CMS Structures](https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc7468.txt)
- Original vulnerability report in Slack #dev channel

Fixes the ReDoS vulnerability while maintaining full compatibility with existing private key detection.

```
$ secretlint ./(group).[foo].md

```

_Originally posted by @azu in https://github.com/secretlint/secretlint/pull/1056#discussion_r2125985117_
            
secretlint supports both path and glob.
However, a file such as `[foo].txt` is actually just a filename, although it is in glob syntax.
It is probably not possible for secretlint to automatically determine this interpretation.

The user would need to specify an option such as `--no-glob`."
3117376704,1059,test: use escapePath instead of convertPathToPattern for glob escaping,devin-ai-integration[bot],158243242,closed,2025-06-04T10:47:53Z,2025-06-04T15:14:39Z,https://github.com/secretlint/secretlint,https://github.com/secretlint/secretlint/pull/1059,"# Test: Use escapePath instead of convertPathToPattern for glob escaping

This PR tests an alternative approach suggested by azu to use fast-glob's `escapePath` function instead of `convertPathToPattern` for handling file paths with special characters.

## Problem
Issue #1057 shows that files with multiple special characters like `(group).[test].md` cause ""Error: Not found target files"" when using `convertPathToPattern`.

## Approach
Replace `convertPathToPattern` with `escapePath` from fast-glob:
- `escapePath` focuses purely on escaping glob special characters (`*?|(){}[]` on Posix, `(){}[]` on Windows)
- `convertPathToPattern` does escaping plus Windows path conversion (backslashes to forward slashes)

## Changes
- Import `escapePath` from fast-glob instead of using `convertPathToPattern` from globby
- Replace the call in `searchFiles` function for static path escaping

## Test Results
- ✅ All existing tests pass (25/25)
- ❌ Combined special characters test case still fails: `input-(group).[test].md` → ""Error: Not found target files""
- ✅ No regressions in existing functionality

## Conclusion
The `escapePath` approach does not resolve the combined special characters issue. The problem appears to be deeper in how glob patterns are processed, not just in the escaping function used.

This suggests that the fallback mechanism in PR #1058 may be the more appropriate solution for handling this edge case.

## What's Changed
### Breaking Changes

* 🚨 BREAKING CHANGE: Drop Node.js 18 support, add Node.js 20-22 support by @azu in https://github.com/secretlint/secretlint/pull/1070
* 🚨 BREAKING CHANGE: Make --maskSecrets the default behavior and add `--no-maskSecrets` flag by @azu in https://github.com/secretlint/secretlint/pull/1068

### Mask secrets in lint error message (Default behavior)

Secretlint v10+ masks secrets in lint error messages by default. This is useful to prevent accidental secret exposure in CI logs, terminal output, or when using AI agent tools.

```bash
# Secrets are masked by default
$ secretlint ""**/*""
```

To show actual secret values in the output, use `--no-maskSecrets`:

```bash
$ secretlint --no-maskSecrets ""**/*""
```

### Refactoring
* fix: use replaceAll instead of split().join() in maskWithValues by @devin-ai-integration in https://github.com/secretlint/secretlint/pull/1066

*_Actual behaviour:_*



**Important: In Production Mode!**

If you visit a shop with affiliateCode and campaignCode parameter like `https://shopdomain/?affiliateCode=TestAffiliate&campaignCode=CampaignTest` and complete an order, the information about the affiliate and campaign code is only stored on a few visits with that specific code (Mostly it's the first visit). If you use the same code again with an other browser or within a private session, this code is not applied to the order.

In my tests this behavior was was on the 2nd order with a given Affiliate and campaign combination. But maybe this also could happen on the 3rd or 4th request.


Reference: https://docs.shopware.com/en/shopware-6-en/tutorials-and-faq/affiliateprogram

*_Expected behaviour:_*



If yo visit a shop with affiliateCode and campaignCode the Affiliate and Campaign parameters are always taken into account and are applied to all Orders / Customer registration.

*_How to reproduce:_*



1. Run an Shop in **ProductionMode**
2. First Testrun:

- Open browser / open private Tab (and not the shop)
- Add additional Parameter like `?affiliateCode=TestAffiliate&campaignCode=CampaignTest` the any shop url and open the Shop in Browser
- Place Order
- Close browser / private Tab

3. Second Testrun:
- Open browser / open private Tab (and not the shop)
- Add additional Parameter like `?affiliateCode=TestAffiliate&campaignCode=CampaignTest` the any shop url and open the Shop in Browser
- Place Order
- Close browser / private Tab
5. Third Testrun
- Open browser / open private Tab (and not the shop)
- Add additional Parameter like `?affiliateCode=TestAffiliate&campaignCode=CampaignTest` the any shop url and open the Shop in Browser
- Place Order
- Close browser / private Tab
7. Fourth Testrun
- Open browser / open private Tab (and not the shop)
- Add additional Parameter like `?affiliateCode=TestAffiliate&campaignCode=CampaignTest` the any shop url and open the Shop in Browser
- Place Order
- Close browser / private Tab
9. Open Shop Backend
10. Check if all Orders have affiliate and campaignCode Parameters

You can use different browsers / private Tabs during the test (as I did)"

This PR improves the `restart-dev-environment` script by replacing the `pkill -f 'pnpm run dev'` approach with a more targeted process management solution using a PID file. This ensures that only the specific dev server process is terminated, avoiding potential issues with killing unrelated processes that might have similar names.

Changes:
- Store the dev server process ID in a `.dev-server.pid` file
- Use the PID file to kill only the specific process when restarting
- Clean up the PID file after terminating the process

This PR addresses feedback on PR #474.

This PR migrates textlint from the deprecated `read-pkg-up` v3 to the modern `read-package-up` v11, while maintaining CommonJS compatibility.

### Changes

- **Package Migration**: `read-pkg-up` v3 → `read-package-up` v11
  - Updated API usage: `pkg` → `packageJson`, `readPkgUpSync` → `readPackageUpSync`
  - Used dynamic imports to maintain CJS compatibility

- **MCP Server Refactoring**: Added `setupServer()` function for better test isolation
  - Removed global server instance
  - Tests can now create/teardown their own server instances

- **Enhanced MCP Compliance**: Improved structured content support (MCP 2025-06-18 specification)
  - All tools return both `content` and `structuredContent`
  - Proper `isError` flags and enhanced error handling

- **Code Quality**: Made `createLinter` synchronous, moved async cache setup to `lintFiles`/`fixFiles`

### Benefits

- Future-proof dependencies using actively maintained packages
- Better testability with proper server isolation
- Enhanced MCP specification compliance
- No breaking changes for users

```

### Expected Behavior

## Feature Request

I want to be able to configure `turbo.json` as follows:

```json
{
  ""meta"": {
    ""disableUpdateChecks"": true
  }
}
```

If I opt-in to this setting, then Turbo will not check to see if there is a new version.

## Why?

Every tool and every library seems to have its own update checks these days. The DX is, log in for the day, start working, see which tool I need to update today. Either I stop what I'm doing to install the update, which is exhausting over a long period of time, or I mentally check out and ignore the version update notice, which defeats the purpose.

To keep my dependencies (including Turbo) up-to-date, I use Renovate Mend (there are alternatives like GitHub's Dependabot), which allows me to not just isolate dependency updates to their own PRs but also to keep these dependency updates restricted to a schedule. Instead of being pressured to update something every day, I can say OK I'll do dependency updates once a week, once every two weeks, once a month, and have the mental space to work on feature development most days.

As a user with automated dependency updating set up, I would like to disable Turbo's built-in update version checking."
2372703051,8599,Package scoping fails when workspace glob has leading `./`,timostamm,4289451,open,2024-06-25T13:26:28Z,,https://github.com/vercel/turborepo,https://github.com/vercel/turborepo/issues/8599,"### Verify canary release

- [X] I verified that the issue exists in the latest Turborepo canary release.

### Link to code that reproduces this issue

https://github.com/timostamm/turbotest

### What package manager are you using / does the bug impact?

npm

### What operating system are you using?

Mac

### Which canary version will you have in your reproduction?

v2.0.5 - there's no newer canary

### Describe the Bug

In an npm project where workspaces are declared with a leading `./`, Automatic Package Scoping is unable to locate the package.

package.json:

```json
{
  ""name"": ""turbotest"",
  ""workspaces"": [
    ""./packages/foo"",
    ""./packages/bar""
  ],
  ""packageManager"": ""npm@9.8.1""
}
```

```bash
$ cd packages/bar
$ npx turbo run test
 WARNING  No locally installed `turbo` found. Using version: 2.0.5.
  × missing packageManager field in package.json
```

It looks like `--filter` requires the leading `./` as well:

```bash
npx turbo run test -F ./packages/bar
• Packages in scope: bar
...
 Tasks:    1 successful, 1 total
```

We do not get a match when omitting `./`:

```bash
$ npx turbo run test -F packages/bar
  × No package found with name 'packages/bar' in workspace
```



### Expected Behavior

I expect filters to match `packages/foo` regardless of the leading `./` declared in the workspace path, same as npm.

Ideally, `./packages/foo` would match both forms. It appears that paths are already normalized (`npx turbo run test -F ./packages/../packages/bar` locates `bar` as expected), but don't normalize the leading `./`.


### To Reproduce

See https://github.com/timostamm/turbotest for a minimal reproducible example.

### To Reproduce

⚠️ **_Not verified yet_**

1. Prepare a TypeScript codebase with valid turbo tasks.
2. Configure GitHub Actions to check the codebase with the `--affected` flag.
3. Push a file with a corrupted file name into a repo (Cyrillic symbols in my case) and run the checks.
4. Observe the failed attempt to run.
5. Try cleaning the GitHub caches / deleting the corrupted file / renaming it
6. Observe the failed attempt to run again.
7. Remove the `--affected` flag.
8. Observe successful runs.

### Additional context

I'm sorry for the incomplete report ― I'll try to finalize it ASAP.
Removing the `--affected` flag helped run the CI, but now it's much slower.

Partial `package.json` to make it clear how we run commands:

```json
{
  ""name"": ""⬛︎⬛︎⬛︎⬛︎⬛︎⬛︎⬛︎"",
  ""scripts"": {
    ""check-all-affected"": ""pnpm run turbo-run --affected _check-all"",
    ""turbo"": ""turbo --color --no-update-notifier"",
    ""turbo-run"": ""pnpm run turbo run --continue=dependencies-successful --env-mode=strict --log-order=stream --cache-dir=./.turbo --concurrency=75%""
  },

    ""pnpm"": ""10.10.0"",
    ""node"": ""22.15.0""
  },

2879921155,8506,Fix hash_test() memory leak in wolfcrypt/test/test.c,gojimmypi,13059545,closed,2025-02-26T01:47:21Z,2025-04-11T17:37:55Z,https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl,https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/8506,"# Description


This PR fixes a memory leak in the `hash_test` function of `wolfcrypt/test/test.c` and adds some Espressif-specific heap checking features.

# Background

The memory leak was first brought to my attention by the Devin automated https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/8471.

I've reviewed the Espressif code. I was unable to find a memory leak. 

I also had ChatGPT review the code. There were some false positives, but after I explained the multi-threaded nature of the library, ChatGPT was also unable to find any memory leak candidates.

From what I can see, there is no memory leak detected in any of the core wolfcrypt hash functions, only the test code around current line 6082 (no line as the file is too big to view online):

```
WOLFSSL_TEST_SUBROUTINE wc_test_ret_t hash_test(void)
```

The problem is manifested when `#define WOLFSSL_SMALL_STACK` is [found](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/blob/3557cc764a7e8d52653e7ee741db3d2f12555817/IDE/Espressif/ESP-IDF/examples/wolfssl_test/components/wolfssl/include/user_settings.h#L352C1-L352C28) in the `user_settings.h`.

Generally the test has been used as a ""_run once and exit_"" app, so it is unlikely anyone noticed there was a memory leak.

In my case, I typically run the tests in a [loop](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/blob/3557cc764a7e8d52653e7ee741db3d2f12555817/IDE/Espressif/ESP-IDF/examples/wolfssl_test/main/main.c#L249) for hours and days on embedded devices. See the [#define TEST_LOOP](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/blob/3557cc764a7e8d52653e7ee741db3d2f12555817/IDE/Espressif/ESP-IDF/examples/wolfssl_test/main/main.c#L56) setting.

After about 1,500+ loops, the ESP32 devices would run out of memory. I incorrectly assumed the problem was Espressif-specific.  

I've run the benchmark in loops on 9 different devices for days now. Between ~5,000 and ~8,000 loops have completed successfully:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a77a8e1-1c23-405a-bd1e-9d337c8acd74)

I've started a similar loop of the wolfcrypt test again with changes in this PR.

# Changes

- There's a new `DEBUG_WOLFSSL_ESP32_HEAP` now documented in `esp32-crypt.h`.

- The `PRINT_HEAP_CHECKPOINT(b, i)` has been modified to accept two parameters: a breadcrumb string (b) and an integer index (i).

- The existing implementation of `PRINT_HEAP_CHECKPOINT` was not otherwise changed. A new `PRINT_HEAP_CHECKPOINT` was added for the Espressif ESP-IDF environment.

- There's a new `PRINT_HEAP_ADDRESS` that prints the address of a newly allocated memory segment. In this PR, the address of the hash object.

- There's a new ""placeholder"" hash type created for _known-but-not-implemented_ hash types. Previously the hash `free` would quietly fail due to type mismatch, contributing to the memory leak.

- The default placeholder type is introduced in a new macro: `PLACEHOLDER_TYPE`. An arbitirary value of `0` is used; the first valid `typesGood[]` item is used when checking bad parameters.

- More return codes are checked (e.g. on `wc_HashFree`) that were not previously checked.

- The logic for ""_is this a valid hash?_"" when checking the `typesNoImpl` list has been revised. It is no longer sensitive to the order of items. It was also probably not fully working as intended anyhow.

- New hash objects are created and destroyed as appropriate in the ""Good type and implemented"" tests.

# Still outstanding

There's still another `test.c` memory leak in or around the PKCS12 test. See message from full log, below:

```
PKCS12   test passed!
I (13430) wc_test: Breadcrumb: TEST_PASS
W (13431) wc_test: Warning: this heap 308088 != last 308128
```

I will look at this one at a later date unless otherwise advised.

It would be nice to have the hash checks for other platforms to give similar warnings. For now the feature is Espressif-specific.

This PR updates the Docker-related headings in all language versions of the website documentation to match the README change in PR #559. The headings are changed from ""For Docker"" (or equivalent in other languages) to ""Using Docker instead of npx"" (or appropriate translations) to clarify that Docker is an alternative to using npx, not a separate tool.

## Changes
- Updated Docker heading in all language versions of the MCP server guide

## Verification
- Ran lint to verify formatting

3022960023,975,falsyな値の例に`0.0`を追加する,otokunaga2,1020125,closed,2025-04-27T09:31:04Z,2025-05-23T11:19:14Z,https://github.com/yytypescript/book,https://github.com/yytypescript/book/issues/975,"いつも参考にさせてもらってます。  
ありがとうございます。  

1点拝見しており、falsyの値の例として`0.0`を追加しても良いかと思いました。  
ご検討のほどどうぞ宜しくお願いします。

> 関数の中も詳しく見てみましょう。まず、setImageUrl("""")で画像URLを初期化しています。これはユーザー体験向上のためです。初期化しないと、再取得完了までに古い画像が表示され続けます。これだと、ボタンをクリックしても見た目の変化がありません。ユーザーが「本当にクリックが効いたのか？」と疑問に思う可能性があります。初期化にすることで、「現在新しい画像を読み込み中です」という状態を視覚的に伝えられます。特にレスポンスがときは、このステップが重要になります。

の「特にレスポンスがときは」というのは、おそらく「特にレスポンスが遅い時は」のことでしょうか？
