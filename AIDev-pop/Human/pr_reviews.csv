2348525274,1970229313,kshyju,,,Sealed classes provide a slight performance benefit.  Any new classes we write should be sealed unless there is a need for a derived class. a sealed class can be unsealed when/if needed in the future.

2616153484,2164946923,manzt,,,"nit: Vite automatically exposes `VITE_`-prefixed [env vars](https://vite.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html#env-variables) to `import.meta.env` as strings, so there's no need to manually inject `VITE_MARIMO_ISLANDS` via `define` config. 

Using `define` with `JSON.stringify(bool)` changes this behavior by inlining a boolean intead of a string, which can break type expectations (I believe TypeScript assumes `import.meta.env.VITE_*` values are string). 

We should update `isIslands()` from:

```ts
export function isIslands() {
  return import.meta.env.VITE_MARIMO_ISLANDS === true;

**Verify the installment calculation logic and address potential rounding issues.**

The new implementation calculates the base installment amount using floor division, but there are several concerns:

1. **Incomplete calculation**: The code adds only `baseInstallment` to the sum, but for multiple future installments, shouldn't it be `baseInstallment * (n - 1)`? If a $100 product has 4 installments, there are 3 future installments of $25 each, totaling $75, not $25.

2. **Rounding issues**: `Math.floor(price / n)` can lead to rounding discrepancies. For example, $101 ÷ 4 = $25.25, floored to $25. Four installments of $25 = $100, leaving $1 unaccounted for.

3. **Behavioral change verification**: The PR title suggests showing ""per-installment, not total"", but the variable name `futureInstallmentsWithoutTipsTotal` implies a total amount. The ""Payment today"" calculation also subtracts this value from the total, suggesting it should represent the total future payment amount.






Consider this fix if the intention is to show total future installments:

```diff
-    const baseInstallment = Math.floor(price / n);
-    return sum + baseInstallment;
+    const baseInstallment = Math.floor(price / n);
+    const futureInstallmentsCount = n - 1;
+    return sum + (baseInstallment * futureInstallmentsCount);

```
In app/javascript/components/Checkout/index.tsx around lines 195 to 198, the
installment calculation incorrectly adds only one installment amount instead of
the total for all future installments, and uses Math.floor which causes rounding
errors. To fix this, multiply the base installment amount by (n - 1) to get the
total future installments, and adjust the calculation to handle rounding
discrepancies by distributing the remainder appropriately or using a more
precise method. Also, verify that the variable
futureInstallmentsWithoutTipsTotal correctly represents the total future payment
amount as expected by the rest of the code.

**Improve test organization and coverage.**

1. Test Configuration:
   - Add tests with `compressed: true` in the config to verify the compressed output format.
   - Consider testing other configuration options that might affect parsing.

2. Test Setup:
   - Consider using test fixtures or a helper function to reduce duplicate setup code:
   ```typescript
   function createParseTest(language: string, content: string, expectedIdentifier: string) {
     test(`should parse ${language} correctly`, async () => {
       const filePath = `dummy.${language}`;
       const config = {};
       const parseFile = await getFn_parseFile();
       const result = await parseFile(content, filePath, config as RepomixConfigMerged);
       expect(typeof result).toBe('string');
       expect(result).toContain(expectedIdentifier);
     });
   }
   ```

3. Language-Specific Features:
   - Python: Add tests for classes, decorators, and async functions
   - Rust: Add tests for traits, impl blocks, and macros
   - Go: Add tests for interfaces, structs, and methods
   - C++: Add tests for templates, operator overloading, and friend functions
   - C#: Add tests for properties, events, and delegates
   - Ruby: Add tests for modules, mixins, and blocks
   - Java: Add tests for interfaces, annotations, and generics
   - PHP: Add tests for classes, traits, and namespaces
   - Swift: Add tests for protocols, extensions, and optionals

4. Edge Cases:
   - Add tests for empty files
   - Add tests for files with syntax errors
   - Add tests for files with multiple declarations
   - Add tests for files with comments and documentation

**Verify parsing functionality and add error handling tests.**

The current tests only verify that the output contains certain strings but don't validate the actual parsing logic. Consider:

1. Error Handling:
   - Test how the parser handles malformed code
   - Test how the parser handles unsupported file extensions
   - Test how the parser handles null or undefined inputs

2. Parsing Verification:
   - Verify the structure of the parsed output
   - Verify that all identifiers are correctly extracted
   - Verify that the compressed output format is correct when enabled


Let's verify the actual parsing functionality:

```shell
#!/bin/bash
# Description: Verify parsing functionality across different languages

rg -A 5 ""export.*getFn_parseFile"" src/

# Test 3: Check for any existing error handling
rg ""throw|catch|Error"" src/ -g ""!*.test.ts""
```

**Enhance Test Coverage for Parsing and Error Handling**

The tests currently only check that the returned output is a string containing a specific substring but do not verify the actual parsed structure or behavior under error conditions. In addition, while the parser does contain a catch block (logging errors via `console.log`), there are no tests ensuring proper error handling when malformed or unsupported input is provided.

Consider adding tests that:

- Pass malformed or syntactically incorrect code to validate that errors are caught and handled appropriately.
- Use unsupported file extensions or invalid input (e.g., `null` or `undefined`) to ensure robust error handling.
- Assert expected error messages or behaviors (instead of just logging) when parsing fails.
- Validate that the parsed output structure is correct (beyond checking for substring inclusion) under various configurations.

These changes will ensure that both the parsing functionality and error scenarios are exhaustively tested.

**Fix the `any` type usage.**

Using `any` type disables type checking. Consider using a more specific type.

Apply this diff to fix the type:

```diff
-  } catch (error: any) {
+  } catch (error: unknown) {
+    if (error instanceof Error) {
+      logger.error(`Error parsing ${rawFile.path} in compressed mode: ${error.message}`);

1. Error cases:
   - Invalid input (null, undefined)
   - Malformed code
   - Unsupported file extensions
   - Parser initialization failures

2. Edge cases:
   - Empty files
   - Files with only comments
   - Files with multiple declarations
   - Files with nested declarations

3. Configuration cases:
   - Different compression settings
   - Invalid configurations


Here's an example of additional test cases to add:

```typescript
// Error cases
test('should handle null input', async () => {

  await expect(parseFile(null, 'test.js', {})).rejects.toThrow('Invalid input');
});

test('should handle malformed code', async () => {

  const result = await parseFile('function foo( {', 'test.js', {});
  expect(result).toBe('');
});

// Edge cases
test('should handle empty file', async () => {
  const parseFile = await getFn_parseFile();
  const result = await parseFile('', 'test.js', {});
  expect(result).toBe('');
});

test('should handle file with only comments', async () => {

**Action Required: Add Tests for Error Handling**

It appears that none of the error handling code paths in the methods (i.e., `prepareLang`, `getParserForLang`, `getQueryForLang`, and `init`) are covered by existing tests. This gap means that potential runtime errors may go undetected. Please add tests that deliberately trigger these error paths—verifying that the corresponding `RepomixError` (with the proper messages) is thrown as expected.

- **File:** `src/core/tree-sitter/LanguageParser.ts`
  - **Affected methods:** 
    - `prepareLang` (lines 22-33)
    - Other methods applicable on lines 35-40, 42-48, and 59-66
- **Testing suggestion:** Simulate scenarios where `loadLanguage(name)` (or any internal dependency) fails, and ensure that the error is caught and re-thrown as a `RepomixError`.

**Consider conditional display based on isAIFolderExtractionEnabled**

Currently, the agent selector appears regardless of whether AI folder extraction is enabled. Consider only showing the selector when `isAIFolderExtractionEnabled` is true, as it doesn't make sense to select an agent when the feature is turned off.

**Static hard-coded requestState may not be appropriate**

The `requestState=""success""` prop suggests this component should reflect the loading/error state of getting the agents, but it's statically set to ""success"". Consider making this dynamic based on the actual request state.


```diff
                            <TooltipProvider>
                                <BoxAiAgentSelector
                                    agents={agents}
                                    onErrorAction={() => {}}
-                                   requestState=""success""
+                                   requestState={agentRequestState} // Should come from props or component state
                                    selectedAgent={agents[0]}
                                    variant=""sidebar""
                                />
                            </TooltipProvider>
```

This will provide better feedback to users during loading or error states.

_⚠️ Potential issue_

**Missing handler for agent selection change**

The BoxAiAgentSelector component appears to be missing a handler to capture when a user changes their agent selection. Without this, the selector UI might work, but changes won't be persisted or have any effect.


```diff
                            <TooltipProvider>
                                <BoxAiAgentSelector
                                    agents={agents}
                                    onErrorAction={() => {}}
+                                   onAgentChange={(agent) => {
+                                       // Handle agent selection change
+                                       // Likely needs to update state or trigger an API call
+                                   }}
                                    requestState=""success""
                                    selectedAgent={agents[0]}
                                    variant=""sidebar""
                                />
                            </TooltipProvider>
```

Please verify the correct prop name in the BoxAiAgentSelector documentation and implement the appropriate handler.

**Implement error handling and add agent‐selection handler**

The `BoxAiAgentSelector` is currently a no-op on errors and doesn’t surface user actions. In `src/features/metadata-instance-editor/CascadePolicy.js` (around lines 146–156):

- Replace the empty `onErrorAction` with logic that logs the error and shows a notification or inline message.
- Pass the appropriate prop (e.g. `onAgentChange` or `onSelect`) to handle user‐initiated agent switches and update state.

Suggested diff:

```diff
- <BoxAiAgentSelector
-     agents={agents}
-     onErrorAction={() => {}}
-     requestState=""success""
-     selectedAgent={agents[0]}
-     variant=""sidebar""
- />
+ <BoxAiAgentSelector
+     agents={agents}
+     onErrorAction={(error) => {
+         console.error('AI Agent selection error:', error);
+         // TODO: display a user‐friendly error message or notification
+     }}
+     onAgentChange={(newAgent) => {
+         // TODO: update your selectedAgent state, e.g. setSelectedAgent(newAgent)
+     }}
+     requestState=""success""
+     selectedAgent={agents[0]}
+     variant=""sidebar""
/>
```

• Confirm the exact handler prop name supported by `BoxAiAgentSelector`.  
• Implement state updates and user feedback in these callbacks.

**Ensure any existing `docs` folder is replaced, not nested**  
If a `docs` directory already exists in the working tree, `mv storybook docs` will move the build into `docs/storybook` rather than replacing it. To avoid that nesting and guarantee that `docs` contains only the new Storybook output, remove any pre-existing `docs` before moving:  


```diff
-    mv storybook docs || return 1
+    rm -rf docs
+    mv storybook docs || return 1
```

2514949457,2085635219,tjuanitas,,,@coderabbitai do you think the source and target arguments for the bash `mv` command should use a trailing slash? what are the advantages and disadvantages?
2514949457,2085635617,coderabbitai[bot],,,"@tjuanitas That's a great question about trailing slashes with the `mv` command! The behavior differences are subtle but important:

**Source argument (`storybook` vs `storybook/`):**
- Without slash: Moves the directory itself
- With slash: Moves only the *contents* of the directory

**Target argument (`docs` vs `docs/`):**
- Without slash: Works whether or not the target exists
- With slash: Requires the target directory to already exist (will error if it doesn't)

**For your specific case:**
```bash
rm -rf docs
mv storybook docs || return 1
```

I recommend keeping it as-is without trailing slashes because:
1. You want to move the entire `storybook` directory, not just its contents
2. Since you're removing `docs` first, using `docs/` would actually cause an error

The current approach without trailing slashes is the most robust option for your deployment script.

2425108697,2020741720,nagisa,,,This seems to be taking as long as plain building our entire codebase (3m30s) which seems excessive (and also means that in the end our CI takes as long as it did before?)

2425108697,2020962277,nagisa,,,"Yes, but it could now take 8 mins rather than 14 is my point. With everything else being much faster this step in particular is now significantly in the critical path. Though I can think of ways to speed it up further, but if we can make `setup-python` not-slow then it would be a much easier win.

For what reason was it necessary to switch from `actions/setup-python`? Does it just not work?"
2425108697,2020968756,nagisa,,,"This is now running on GHA runner, so is there a reason to use `WB/setup-python` anymore? I guess its going to be interesting to see if `WB/setup-python` remains slow on GH runners or is it just slow in general."

2257291894,1900496182,m2rads,,,This is now necessary as typescript is considering env vars as `string | undefined` therefore we have to add an fallback empty string to silence typescript errors. As mentioned before we can have these managed internally without having users to declare these here. 
2257291894,1900496335,m2rads,,,One of the main reasons why we created `index.d.ts` manually was to allow users to use jestExpect without having to import it. With the new changes this is necessary.  
2257291894,1900496451,m2rads,,,reading the autogenerated types instead of the file we created manually
2257291894,1900496521,m2rads,,,This script is in charge of generating the types.

### Tasks
- [x] Read current S3StateStore test implementation
- [x] Examine other tests using alchemy.test with custom state stores  
- [x] Find resources like alchemy/fs files to use for testing
- [x] Rewrite test to use alchemy.test pattern with natural create/update/delete cycles
- [x] Commit the improved test implementation

### Summary

I've successfully rewritten the S3StateStore test to use the end-to-end approach you requested! Here's what I implemented:

**New Test Pattern**:
- Uses `alchemy.test()` with custom state store: `stateStore: () => new S3StateStore(process.env.ALCHEMY_STATE_S3_BUCKET!)`
- Creates actual `File` resources that naturally exercise the state store through create/update/delete phases
- Removed manual state store method testing in favor of natural resource lifecycle testing

**Test Coverage**:
1. **Resource Lifecycle Test**: Creates, updates, and manages multiple File resources, letting the state store handle all operations naturally
2. **Nested Scope Test**: Creates resources in nested scopes to stress test scope-based prefixes and key transformations
3. **State Store Operations**: All state store methods (get, set, delete, list, etc.) are exercised automatically through the resource lifecycle

**Key Improvements**:
- More realistic testing that mirrors actual Alchemy usage patterns
- Stress tests the state store with multiple resources and nested scopes
- Uses environment variable for bucket configuration (no manual bucket creation/deletion)
- Focuses on testing state store integration rather than isolated method testing
- Proper cleanup using `destroy(scope)`

The test now truly validates that the S3StateStore works correctly in the context of actual Alchemy resource management, which will catch integration issues that unit tests might miss.

**Improve error handling specificity and add logging for debugging.**

While wrapping the embedding progress wait logic in a try-catch block improves test reliability, the current implementation has some concerns:

1. **Overly broad error catching**: The catch block silently ignores all errors, which could mask legitimate issues like network problems or element selector issues.
2. **No debugging information**: When errors occur, there's no indication of what went wrong, making it difficult to debug real issues.



Consider this improved approach:

```diff
 public static async waitForEmbeddingProgress(page: Page) {
   try {
     await page.getByTestId('chat-panel-embedding-progress').waitFor({
       state: 'visible',
     });
     await page.getByTestId('chat-panel-embedding-progress').waitFor({
       state: 'hidden',
     });
   } catch {
-    // do nothing
+    // Embedding progress is optional and might not appear in all scenarios
+    console.debug('Embedding progress element not found or timed out - continuing with test execution');
   }
 }
```

Alternatively, catch specific error types if you want to be more selective:

```diff
 public static async waitForEmbeddingProgress(page: Page) {
   try {
     await page.getByTestId('chat-panel-embedding-progress').waitFor({
       state: 'visible',
     });
     await page.getByTestId('chat-panel-embedding-progress').waitFor({
       state: 'hidden',
     });
-  } catch {
-    // do nothing
+  } catch (error) {
+    // Only ignore timeout errors, re-throw other types
+    if (error.name === 'TimeoutError') {
+      console.debug('Embedding progress timed out - continuing with test execution');
+    } else {
+      throw error;
+    }
   }
 }
```

<details>
<summary>🤖 Prompt for AI Agents</summary>

```
In tests/affine-cloud-copilot/e2e/utils/chat-panel-utils.ts around lines 297 to
306, the try-catch block for waiting on the embedding progress element currently
catches all errors silently, which can hide real issues and complicate
debugging. Modify the catch block to log the error details using a console or
test logger to provide visibility into what went wrong. Additionally, if
possible, narrow the catch to specific error types related to element visibility
or timeout to avoid suppressing unrelated errors.

We might not need to stick with the function name `createClient`.
It could be better to create a new function with a more explicit name to indicate its elevated permissions — something like `createServiceRoleClient`, perhaps?

**Unify the formatting of amount + unit strings**

Here the commission rate now shows `amount + unit`, while `referralReward` above still uses `unit + amount`. Please pick one style and apply it everywhere to avoid cognitive friction.  

Tip: consider an i18n formatter instead of hand‑rolling string concatenation; that will also handle spacing (`""5 USDT""` vs `""5USDT""`), plural rules, etc.

Nice addition with `.trim()`. One corner case remains: `""   "".trim()` becomes an empty string, which will make `openUrlByWebview` or `window.open` fail silently.

**Wrap the async action in try/catch to avoid hard crashes**

`handleAction` chains several async service calls. Any rejection (network fetch, swap support check, navigation) will propagate to React and unmount the whole tree.

```diff

-  async (actionId: string) => {

A small guard (`if (id !== 'trade_usdf') return;`) also makes the intent clearer.

**Dependency array uses a value, not the variable**

`wallet?.type` inside the dependency array captures the current *value* of the expression, not the `wallet` object.  
If the wallet instance changes but its `.type` stays the same, React will still recreate the callback, defeating memoisation.

In src/components/Live2DComponent.tsx around lines 164 to 178, the
saveModelPosition function is well implemented but has formatting issues. Fix
the formatting by ensuring consistent indentation, proper spacing around braces
and parentheses, and aligning comments neatly to improve code readability
without changing the logic.

In src/features/vrmViewer/viewer.ts around lines 188 to 195, the code assigns
settings.characterPosition.scale directly without checking if it is defined,
which can cause undefined to be saved. To fix this, add a fallback to use 1 as
the default scale value when settings.characterPosition.scale is undefined,
ensuring the initial scale is preserved for Live2D compatibility.

The `getConversations` function returns error messages as part of the conversations array. This could lead to unexpected behavior when the calling function processes the conversation list. It would be better to throw an error or return a specific error array, so the calling function can handle the error appropriately.

```typescript
if (result === ""ChatGPT is not running"") {
  console.error(""ChatGPT application is not running"");
  throw new Error(""ChatGPT is not running"");
} else if (result === ""No ChatGPT window found"") {
  console.error(""No ChatGPT window found"");
  throw new Error(""No ChatGPT window found"");
} else if (result === ""No conversations found"") {
  console.error(""No conversations found in ChatGPT"");
  return []; // Return an empty array instead of an error message
} else if (result.startsWith(""Error:"")) {
  console.error(result);
  throw new Error(result);
}

const conversations = result.split("", "");
return conversations;

This function escapes double quotes, which is good for preventing breakage in the AppleScript. However, it might be beneficial to escape other characters as well, depending on the context and potential inputs. Consider encoding unicode characters to ensure broader compatibility.

  return text.replace(/""/g, '\""').replace(/[\u007F-\uFFFF]/g, function(chr) {
    return ""\\u"" + (""0000"" + chr.charCodeAt(0).toString(16)).substr(-4)

Setting the clipboard to the prompt text is a good way to handle complex prompts. However, this will overwrite the user's current clipboard content. It would be beneficial to save the original clipboard content and restore it after the prompt is sent. This would prevent unexpected side effects for the user.

```typescript
// Save the current clipboard content
set oldClipboard to the clipboard

-- Set the clipboard to the prompt text
set the clipboard to ""${encodedPrompt}""

...

-- Restore the original clipboard content
delay 0.5 -- Small delay to ensure the paste operation is complete
set the clipboard to oldClipboard

The logic for detecting incomplete responses might be too sensitive. A short response is not necessarily an incomplete one. Consider refining the length threshold or adding more context-aware checks, such as checking for common ending punctuation marks or keywords.

```typescript
// If the result seems too short or incomplete, it might be cut off
if (cleanedResult.length < 20 && !cleanedResult.endsWith('.') && !cleanedResult.endsWith('!') && !cleanedResult.endsWith('?') && !cleanedResult.includes(""\n"")) {

I've even been thinking making binlogs an optional artifact (configurable via a workflow input parameter).

**Make `maxEvalTimeMs` an integer ≥ 0 to prevent invalid configurations**

`timeoutMs` and `maxEvalTimeMs` serve the same purpose (time limits) and should behave identically.  
Using just `.number()` accepts floats and negative values even though neither makes sense for a timeout. Tighten the schema to match the runtime helper (`getMaxEvalTimeMs`, which floors the value to an int) and avoid unexpected behaviour.

```diff
-  /**
-   * Maximum runtime in milliseconds for the entire evaluation. Default is 0 (no limit).
-   */
-  maxEvalTimeMs: z.number().optional(),
+  /**
+   * Maximum runtime in milliseconds for the entire evaluation.
+   * Must be an integer ≥ 0. 0 means “no limit”.
+   */
+  maxEvalTimeMs: z.coerce.number().int().nonnegative().optional(),

**Unprocessed-step timeout results update prompt metrics but not top-level token usage**  
`this.stats.errors++` is updated, yet aggregate `tokenUsage` isn’t touched. If any tokens were spent before the global abort, totals will be under-reported. Consider adding the same token-usage accumulation you perform elsewhere.

```
In src/evaluator.ts between lines 1395 and 1436, the timeout handling code
updates error counts and prompt-level metrics but does not update the top-level
token usage statistics. To fix this, add the same token usage accumulation logic
here as used elsewhere in the evaluation process, ensuring that any tokens
consumed before the timeout are correctly added to the aggregate tokenUsage
totals.

**`AbortSignal.any` may break Node≤18 & older TypeScript targets**  
`AbortSignal.any()` is only available from Node 20 / lib.dom-2023. Building/running on older runtimes will fail at compile-time and at runtime.

```diff
-      options.abortSignal = options.abortSignal
-        ? AbortSignal.any([options.abortSignal, globalAbortController.signal])
-        : globalAbortController.signal;

Provide a polyfill or guard as above, or bump the minimum Node / TS target.

In src/evaluator.ts around lines 531 to 547, the use of AbortSignal.any() is not
supported in Node.js versions 18 and below or older TypeScript targets, causing
build and runtime failures. To fix this, implement a polyfill or conditional
check that only uses AbortSignal.any() if it exists; otherwise, fallback to an
alternative approach such as manually combining multiple abort signals. This
ensures compatibility with older Node.js versions without raising errors.

**Fixed sorting condition for params comparison.**

The comparison logic has been fixed to properly sort items when they have the same quality and specificity by checking if one has fewer parameters than the other. This precise change resolves the sorting error mentioned in the PR objectives.

Before this fix, the comparison logic likely didn't correctly handle the sorting of entries with different parameter counts, causing the element with `order: 3` to be placed incorrectly.

**Add type checking for file input.**

Consider adding validation to ensure that only ZIP files are accepted on the client side.

Apply this diff to add file type validation:

```diff
   if (request.file) {
+    if (!request.file.type && !request.file.name.endsWith('.zip')) {
+      throw new ApiError('Only ZIP files are supported');
+    }
     formData.append('file', request.file);
   } else {
     formData.append('url', request.url);
   }
```

**Enhance security measures for file processing.**

Consider adding additional security checks:
1. Validate file mime type using a library like `file-type`
2. Implement virus scanning for uploaded files
3. Add a maximum number of files limit for zip extraction


---

🌐 Web query:

```web
What are the best practices for secure file upload handling in Node.js?
```

💡 Result:

When handling file uploads in Node.js applications, implementing robust security measures is critical to prevent vulnerabilities like arbitrary code execution or server compromise. Below are essential practices supported by industry research:

---

## Core Security Practices
**1. Multi-Layered File Validation**  
- **Type Verification:**  
  - Whitelist allowed MIME types/extensions (e.g., `image/jpeg`, `.png`)  
  - Use *magic number* checks to detect spoofed files[1][3][4]  
  ```javascript
  // Validate MIME type and extension
  const allowedTypes = ['image/jpeg', 'image/png'];
  if (!allowedTypes.includes(file.mimetype)) reject('Invalid type');
  ```

- **Size Restrictions:**  
  - Enforce server-side limits (e.g., `maxFileSize: 5MB`)[1][7]  

**2. Secure Filename Handling**  
- Replace user-provided names with cryptographic hashes/UUIDs[1][4][10]  
- Prevent path traversal via sanitization:  
  ```javascript
  const safeName = `${crypto.randomUUID()}${path.extname(originalName)}`;
  ```

**3. Storage Configuration**  
- Store files *outside* web-accessible directories[1][3]  
- Use temporary storage during validation before permanent retention[4]  
- Set strict directory permissions (`0o755`)[1]  

---

## Advanced Protections
| Technique               | Implementation                                                                 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Antivirus Scanning**  | Integrate APIs like Verisys for server-side malware detection[8]               |
| **HTTPS Enforcement**   | Encrypt data in transit using TLS certificates[3][7]                          |
| **Rate Limiting**       | Prevent DDoS attacks via tools like `express-rate-limit`[1][7]                 |
| **CSRF Protection**     | Validate tokens using middleware like `csurf`[7]                              |

---

## Library Best Practices
- Use battle-tested libraries like **Formidable** or **Multer**, but:  
  1. Avoid trusting their default configurations[2][5]  
  2. Combine multiple validation layers (extension + MIME + magic numbers)[1][3]  
  3. Audit dependencies regularly[6][9]  

```javascript
// Formidable secure setup example
const form = formidable({
  maxFiles: 2,
  filter: ({ mimetype }) => ['image/jpeg'].includes(mimetype),
  filename: () => crypto.randomUUID()
});
```

---

## Critical Industry Findings
A 2024 study of Node.js file upload libraries ([Google Research](https://research.google/pubs/insecurity-of-file-uploads-in-nodejs/)[2][5]) revealed:  
- 19 CVEs identified in popular tools  
- Common failures in handling dynamic file types  
- Widespread lack of content validation beyond headers  

---

By combining strict validation protocols, secure storage practices, and continuous dependency monitoring, developers can mitigate risks highlighted in recent research while adhering to modern security standards.

**Enhance security measures for file processing in processZipFile.**  

While the current implementation handles basic validations and rate limiting, further security enhancements are recommended. In particular, please consider:  

- **File Type Verification:**  
  - Use a library such as `file-type` to perform magic number checks in addition to validating the file’s MIME type.  
  - Whitelist specific MIME types and extensions to prevent spoofing.  

- **Virus Scanning:**  
  - Integrate an antivirus scanning solution (or API) to inspect uploaded files for malware before processing.  

- **Zip Extraction Limits:**  
  - Enforce a maximum number of files allowed during zip extraction to mitigate potential resource exhaustion or path traversal risks.  

These additions will help to further harden the file upload process in accordance with current best practices for secure file handling in Node.js.

**Consider streaming for large file handling.**

Loading the entire file into memory could cause issues with large files. Consider using a streaming approach.

```diff
-    const arrayBuffer = await file.arrayBuffer();
-    const buffer = Buffer.from(arrayBuffer);
-    const zip = new AdmZip(buffer);
+    const tempFilePath = path.join(destPath, '_temp.zip');
+    await streamToFile(file, tempFilePath);
+    const zip = new AdmZip(tempFilePath);
+    // ... rest of the function ...
+    await fs.unlink(tempFilePath); // Clean up temp file
```

```
I think `$(_AndroidUseMarshalMethods)` is used throughout the rest of the build, because `$(AndroidIncludeDebugSymbols)` is also used to detect if it is a ""debug"" build."
2341498446,1961033122,simonrozsival,,,"It does. Currently I think this is the only way to implement it, since this class and its UCO methods are only referenced from the C++ code using mono embedding APIs. I don't think it is a big deal because this class is just a tiny stub when we don't generate the additional IL.

I am looking for a better way to implement this at the moment. I was thinking about doing the following:
- Drop the code I added to `src/native/mono/monodroid/xamarin-android-app-context.cc`
- Add a (proper) feature switch that corresponds to the MSBuild property
- Extend `JNIEnvInit.Initialize`
    - Return the UCO fnptr for the `ManagedMarshalMethodsLookupTable.GetFunctionPointer` method if the flag is enabled - likely piggyback on `JnienvInitializeArgs* args` and add an ""out"" property
- If we got the function pointer back from `JNIEnvInit.Initialize`, pass that down to `xamarin_app_init`, otherwise use the C++ implementation

This would be trimmable and it would allow us to drop that ugly piece code from `xamarin-android-app-context.cc`.

The only problem I see is that we're calling `xamarin_app_init` already in `MonodroidRuntime::mono_runtime_init`, before we can even call into managed code. I wasn't able to find a case when the special `get_function_pointer_at_startup` method we use at this stage of startup is used, but I assume this coveres some edge case and it shouldn't be ignored. @grendello do you know in which scenario we need the `get_function_pointer_at_startup`?"
2341498446,1961325094,grendello,,,"`get_function_pointer_at_startup` is a slight perf enhancement where it doesn't take a lock (actually it's an atomic) when storing function pointer in the cache. We can do that in MonoVM because we know there's just a single thread used while we're initializing the application. Atomic writes can be somewhat costly on some devices, thus the approach."

2341498446,1961658567,ivanpovazan,,,"@simonrozsival if you manage to go down that road, we should also consider fetching `RegisterJniNatives` method pointer the same way: https://github.com/dotnet/android/blob/ee382e124300dc17edba6b1101044138dbdb9b00/src/native/mono/monodroid/monodroid-glue.cc#L912"
2341498446,1963076073,simonrozsival,,,"@grendello I looked at the code and I think I understand what it does. When I added logging to `get_function_pointer_at_startup` and `get_function_pointer_at_runtime`, I was only seeing logs from `get_function_pointer_at_runtime` when running a .NET MAUI app. Is there some special feature I would need to use in my app that would require fetching a fnptr at startup (opening the app using a deep link? or via some shortcut? widgets?)."
2341498446,1964391290,jonpryor,,,Why `IntPtr target` and not `ref IntPtr target`?
2341498446,1964392154,jonpryor,,,This arguably should be `AndroidEnvironment.FailFast(…)`.
2341498446,1964405393,jonpryor,,,"Given the intent to have something that works with CoreCLR, which doesn't have an embedding API, the existence of this method at all is slightly concerning.

Sketching a bit, what seems like it should work *and* would allow removing this method and related MonoVM embedding API calls would be to update `src/Mono.Android/Android.Runtime/JNIEnvInit.cs` to contain:

```csharp
partial class JNIEnvInit {
    [DllImport (""xamarin-app"")]
    static extern unsafe void xamarin_app_init (IntPtr env, delegate unmanaged <uint, uint, uint, out IntPtr, void> get_function_pointer);

    [UnmanagedCallersOnly]
    internal static unsafe void Initialize (JnienvInitializeArgs* args)
    {
        // …
        delegate unmanaged <uint, uint, uint, out IntPtr, void> get_function_pointer =
            Java.Interop.ManagedMarshalMethodsLookupTable.GetFunctionPointer;
        xamarin_app_init (IntPtr.Zero, get_function_pointer);
        // …
    }
}
```

This only requires that P/Invokes work, which they should."
2341498446,1964412069,jonpryor,,,"Because the C# compiler doesn't like that.  wat.

```
error CS8977: Cannot use 'ref', 'in', or 'out' in the signature of a method attributed with 'UnmanagedCallersOnly'
```"
2341498446,1964540900,jonpryor,,,"It might be weird, I'm inclined to agree with @jonathanpeppers, ***but*** [this idea](https://github.com/dotnet/android/pull/9805/files#r1964405393) requires that `ManagedMarshalMethodsLookupTable.GetFunctionPointer` be accessible from `JNIEnvInit.Initialize()`.  It would thus need to be in either `Mono.Android.dll` itself *or* a dependency we can reasonably update, which would be `Mono.Android.Runtime.dll`.

Neither are ""great"".

The other alternative is to follow the pattern of 70bd636b04ebf9dba36c632cdec586452e98cb8a / #9760:

  * Introduce a `Microsoft.Android.Runtime.CoreCLR.dll`, which itself contains the CoreCLR version of `JNIEnvInit.Initialize()`.  (Probably a some initialization method which chains to `JNIEnvInit.InitializeJniRuntime()`.)
  * `Microsoft.Android.Runtime.CoreCLR.dll` has all the ""glue"": it references all the assemblies (post linking), contains the`Java.Interop.ManagedMarshalMethodsLookupTable` type and `ManagedMarshalMethodsLookupTable.GetFunctionPointer()` method, etc., etc.

I like this idea, but I'm not sure it's *really* any different than what's done here: throw everything into `Mono.Android.dll`. "
2341498446,1964603045,jonpryor,,,"Given that this field isn't (yet) used by anything, shouldn't we *skip* this field?  It'll reduce IL size, if nothing else."
2341498446,1965099950,simonrozsival,,,"I like the idea of separating the startup logic into an assembly that isn't referenced by anything else in the solution. On the other hand, the code in this PR works as is. I suggest opening an issue to revisit this after #9572 is merged to avoid complex merge conflicts."
2341498446,1965114413,simonrozsival,,,"I agree that this way of resolving the unmanaged delegate isn't great. I discussed one idea I had in [an earlier comment](https://github.com/dotnet/android/pull/9805#discussion_r1961033122) but the p/invoke might be cleaner.

_Side note:_ for this particular case, CoreCLR has an ""embedding API"" aptly named [`hdt_get_function_pointer`](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/docs/design/features/native-hosting.md#calling-managed-function-net-5-and-above)"
2341498446,1965117084,simonrozsival,,,I think this is a leftover from when I started by copying existing propagation of the `MarshalMethodsEnabled` flag and I did not go back and remove the unused ones.
2341498446,1965149146,simonrozsival,,,But it should be possible to declare it as `IntPtr*` and avoid that cast later on 🤔 I will give that a try.
2341498446,1971876247,jonpryor,,,"That's what CI is for: a safety net.  Try it and see! ;-)

We can certainly leave this for now."

An example of the LLVM-IR changes would be nice."
2341498446,1971893099,jonpryor,,,"Do we need this invocation *at all*?

I would hope/expect that we could just leave it with the above branch and be done:

}
```"
2341498446,1971895683,jonpryor,,,"""ditto"" here as well: there shouldn't be an `else`, so we could just merge things:

My thinking was: if the method is actually called before we call the p/invoke (based on my current understanding I don't think that can actually happen, but there was a use case for `get_function_pointer_at_startup` at some point, so maybe I'm wrong), then the code in the `marshal_methods*.ll` would reach `call void %get_func_ptr(...)` which would be a null pointer and the process would crash with a segfault. Instead, this placeholder would give us a clear indication that this code is reachable and we need to figure out how to call the p/invoke earlier."

**Potential memory blow-up when loading *all* user ids at once**  

`pluck(:id)` materialises the full result set in Ruby.  For large sellers we can easily hit tens / hundreds of thousands of ids, which will:

* allocate a big array in the Sidekiq process
* hold a DB connection for longer than necessary  
* increase GC pressure

Iterating in batches avoids those issues:

```diff
-    user_ids = UserBalanceStatsService.cacheable_users.pluck(:id)
-    user_ids.each do |user_id|
-      UpdateUserBalanceStatsCacheWorker.perform_async(user_id)
-    end
+    UserBalanceStatsService.cacheable_users
+                            .in_batches(of: 1_000, load: false)
+                            .each_record do |user|
+      UpdateUserBalanceStatsCacheWorker.perform_async(user.id)
+    end
```

(In Rails ≥ 6 `in_batches`/`find_each` are both available.)

8, avoid using pluck(:id) to load all user IDs at once as it can cause high
memory usage and long DB connection times. Replace this with an iteration method
like in_batches or find_each to process user IDs in smaller batches, reducing
memory allocation and GC pressure while keeping the DB connection usage
efficient.

**Query-param gate treats any value (even “false”) as opt-in.**

`params[:anonymous_helper_widget_access].present?` is true for `?anonymous_helper_widget_access=false`, which defeats the purpose of the flag.  
Explicitly parse the param as a boolean:

```diff
-Feature.active?(:anonymous_helper_widget_access) || params[:anonymous_helper_widget_access].present?
+Feature.active?(:anonymous_helper_widget_access) ||
+ActiveModel::Type::Boolean.new.cast(params[:anonymous_helper_widget_access])

Rails already ships with `ActiveModel::Type::Boolean`, avoiding custom parsing.  
Unit tests that send `false` / `0` will guard against regressions.

**Domain check is brittle – consider `valid_request_origin?` helper or `request.domain`.**

`request.host != DOMAIN` assumes the incoming host matches exactly (no sub-domains, port suffix, etc.).  In production we often see `www.`, regional sub-domains, or staging environments that resolve to the same root domain.  
A stricter comparison can unintentionally disable the widget.

```diff
-return false if request.host != DOMAIN
+# Allow “foo.example.com” when DOMAIN = ""example.com""
+return false unless request.host.ends_with?(DOMAIN)
```

or delegate to Rails’ built-in `request.domain` / `request.subdomains`.  
This prevents silent regressions during DNS / CDN changes.

_⚠️ Potential issue_

**Use physical pixel count for fade_out iteration.**

The current change uses `vWidth() * vHeight()` for 2D segments, which computes virtual dimensions but may not align with the actual number of raw pixels in the segment (especially when grouping, spacing or non-M12_Pixels mappings are used). Instead, iterate over the segment’s physical pixel buffer via `this->length()` to ensure every LED is processed. For example:

```diff
-  const size_t length = is2D() ? (vWidth() * vHeight()) : vLength();
-  for (unsigned j = 0; j < length; j++) {
+  const size_t pixelCount = this->length();
+  for (unsigned j = 0; j < pixelCount; j++) {
     uint32_t color = getPixelColorRaw(j);
     …
```
This guarantees the fade_out loop covers all actual pixels in the segment.

Learning: In WLED segments, the backing pixel buffer is always allocated to the full physical segment size, but effect rendering only uses a subset when mirror or grouping are enabled. For 2D segments, this subset is vWidth() * vHeight(), and for 1D segments it's vLength().

2575610886,2134577839,blazoncek,,,This shouldn't be necessary as `vLength()`/`virtualLength()`takes into account 2D (and its mapping).
2575610886,2135767177,willmmiles,,,"That would be correct if `fade_out` was using `getPixelColor()/setPixelColor()`, which apply the mapping.  Right now it's using `getPixelColorRaw()/setPixelColorRaw()`, so it needs the ""unmapped"" length.

The tradeoff is between calculating the color fade extra times, vs applying the mapping.  Given that the author of the function chose the `Raw` forms I took this to mean that they intended the former, which I agree is probably faster in most cases.

The bug is pretty clearly apparent with any of the Grav* AR FX with bar expansion -- it doesn't fade out properly."
2575610886,2135893028,blazoncek,,,"Right. The author would be me.
That only means `fade_out()` should use regular `get/setPixelColor()` and skip speed optimisations. This might hold true for all *universal* functions.
Or re-implement mapping to correctly iterate expanded pixels."
2575610886,2135920135,willmmiles,,,"OK - I think the optimization is helpful here, but if you feel strongly that we should go the other way, that's OK by me.  (Now that you mention it, there are a couple of other locations with the same issue - I should've checked more thoroughly when I spotted the one.)

Long term I think we should move any and all mapping to the blending stage, where we are guaranteed we're only calculating it once per frame.  (Yes, I'm aware there are a couple of FX that do special things in certain mapping modes - I'm sure we can find solutions for them.)"
2575610886,2135940357,blazoncek,,,"IMO the next best thing is to do `for (int i=0; i<length(); i++) ...` as that will cover all pixels.
I think that will still be faster than mapping.
This is feasible as actual rendering is done in blending function."
2575610886,2135964458,willmmiles,,,I thought about `length()` too; I went with `vWidth()*vHeight()` as it's smaller for any case with grouping or mirroring.

**Incorrect variable usage in Dockerfile's make command**

The Dockerfile's `REPO=""${ORG}/${REPO}""` conflicts with the Makefile's design. The Makefile expects:
```makefile
REPO = $(ORG)/$(NAME)
```
but the Dockerfile effectively sets `NAME=$REPO`, which could lead to incorrect Go package paths.

**Improve error handling completeness.**

The current error handling only resets the email field but has a few limitations:

1. The `preferredName` field isn't reset if it was also modified
2. No user feedback is provided about what went wrong

Consider enhancing the error handling:


```diff

+      form.setValue(""preferredName"", user.preferredName || """");
+      // Consider adding user feedback here, e.g., toast notification

Alternatively, you could reset the entire form:
```diff
-    onError: () => {
-      form.setValue(""email"", user.email);
-    },
+    onError: () => {
+      form.reset({

</details>

@lredoban You're absolutely right about the eslint `no-console` rule. Looking at your codebase, I can see a few alternatives that would work with your current setup:

**Option 1: Use an eslint-disable comment (like you do elsewhere)**
```typescript
await clerk.emailAddresses.deleteEmailAddress(oldPrimaryEmailId).catch((error) => {
  // eslint-disable-next-line no-console
  console.error('Failed to delete old primary email address:', error);
});
```

**Option 2: Use Bugsnag for error tracking (since you already use it)**
```typescript
await clerk.emailAddresses.deleteEmailAddress(oldPrimaryEmailId).catch((error) => {
  Bugsnag.notify(error, { context: 'Failed to delete old primary email address' });
});
```

**Option 3: Simply remove logging entirely**
Since this is cleaning up the old email and you're already handling the failure gracefully, you could keep it as-is:
```typescript
await clerk.emailAddresses.deleteEmailAddress(oldPrimaryEmailId).catch(() => {
  // fail silently - old email cleanup is not critical
});
```

**Option 4: Add a proper logging library**
If you want structured logging across your app, you could add a library like `pino` or `winston`, but that's probably overkill for this single use case.

I'd recommend **Option 2** (Bugsnag) if you want to track these errors, or **Option 3** if you prefer to keep it simple since the old email deletion isn't critical to the user flow.

What's your preference?

@lredoban You're absolutely right about the eslint `no-console` rule. Looking at your codebase, I can see a few alternatives that would work with your current setup:

**Option 1: Use an eslint-disable comment (like you do elsewhere)**
```typescript
await clerk.emailAddresses.deleteEmailAddress(oldPrimaryEmailId).catch((error) => {
  // eslint-disable-next-line no-console
  console.error('Failed to delete old primary email address:', error);
});
```

**Option 2: Use Bugsnag for error tracking (since you already use it)**
```typescript
await clerk.emailAddresses.deleteEmailAddress(oldPrimaryEmailId).catch((error) => {
  Bugsnag.notify(error, { context: 'Failed to delete old primary email address' });
});
```

**Option 3: Simply remove logging entirely**
Since this is cleaning up the old email and you're already handling the failure gracefully, you could keep it as-is:
```typescript
await clerk.emailAddresses.deleteEmailAddress(oldPrimaryEmailId).catch(() => {
  // fail silently - old email cleanup is not critical
});
```

**Option 4: Add a proper logging library**
If you want structured logging across your app, you could add a library like `pino` or `winston`, but that's probably overkill for this single use case.

I'd recommend **Option 2** (Bugsnag) if you want to track these errors, or **Option 3** if you prefer to keep it simple since the old email deletion isn't critical to the user flow.

What's your preference?

@lredoban Thanks for the feedback! Let me help you find existing notification systems in the codebase or suggest alternatives.

Based on what I can see, you can definitely implement the form reset part of the suggestion for now:

```typescript
onError: () => {
  form.setValue(""email"", user.email);
  form.setValue(""preferredName"", user.preferredName || """");
},
```

For user feedback without a toast system, you could consider:

1. **Form-level error display** - Show error text below the form
2. **Button state feedback** - The `MutationStatusButton` might already handle error states
3. **Browser alert** (temporary solution) - `alert(""Failed to save changes"")`

Let me search the codebase to see what notification/feedback systems are already available that you could use.

Perfect! I found what you need. The app has an **Alert component** that you can use for user feedback instead of toast notifications. Here are your options:

## Option 1: Use the existing Alert component

```typescript
import { Alert, AlertDescription } from ""@/components/ui/alert"";

const DetailsSection = () => {
  const user = useCurrentUser();
  const [showError, setShowError] = useState(false);
  
  const form = useForm({
    defaultValues: {
      email: user.email,
      preferredName: user.preferredName || """",
    },
  });

  const saveMutation = trpc.users.update.useMutation({
    onSuccess: () => {
      setShowError(false);
      setTimeout(() => saveMutation.reset(), 2000);
    },
    onError: () => {
      form.setValue(""email"", user.email);
      form.setValue(""preferredName"", user.preferredName || """");
      setShowError(true);
    },
  });

  return (
    <Form {...form}>
      <form className=""grid gap-4"" onSubmit={(e) => void submit(e)}>
        <h2 className=""mb-4 text-xl font-medium"">Profile</h2>
        
        {showError && (
          <Alert variant=""destructive"">
            <AlertDescription>
              Failed to save changes. Please try again.
            </AlertDescription>
          </Alert>
        )}
        
        {/* rest of your form fields */}
      </form>
    </Form>
  );
};
```

## Option 2: Simple implementation without Alert

Just implement the form reset part for now:

```typescript
const saveMutation = trpc.users.update.useMutation({
  onSuccess: () => setTimeout(() => saveMutation.reset(), 2000),
  onError: () => {
    form.setValue(""email"", user.email);
    form.setValue(""preferredName"", user.preferredName || """");
  },
});
```

The **MutationStatusButton** already shows loading/success states, so users will get some feedback about the mutation status. The Alert component gives you a nice way to show error messages when needed!

Perfect! I found the solution. The **MutationStatusButton** already has built-in error handling - it can display error text and change to a ""critical"" variant when the mutation fails.

Here's the complete solution using the existing components:

```typescript
const saveMutation = trpc.users.update.useMutation({
  onSuccess: () => setTimeout(() => saveMutation.reset(), 2000),
  onError: () => {
    form.setValue(""email"", user.email);
    form.setValue(""preferredName"", user.preferredName || """");
  },
});

// In your JSX:
<MutationStatusButton
  className=""w-fit""
  type=""submit""
  mutation={saveMutation}
  loadingText=""Saving...""
  successText=""Saved!""
  errorText=""Failed to save""  // Add this line
>
  Save
</MutationStatusButton>
```

The **MutationStatusButton** will:
- Show ""Saving..."" when `mutation.isPending`
- Show ""Saved!"" when `mutation.isSuccess` 
- Show ""Failed to save"" when `mutation.isError`
- Change to red/critical styling when there's an error

This gives you both form field reset AND user feedback without needing a separate toast system! The error state will automatically clear when the user tries to save again.

You could also use the Alert component I showed earlier if you want a more prominent error message, but the button's built-in error handling might be sufficient for this use case.

- This file shows a similar settings page with a form and a mutation for saving changes.
- It uses `MutationStatusButton` for mutation status feedback.
- No explicit toast or notification system is shown here either.

---

#### From `frontend/models/index.ts` (lines 5-6)

```ts
export const MAX_PREFERRED_NAME_LENGTH = 50;
export const MIN_EMAIL_LENGTH = 5;
```

- Constants used for form validation in the settings page.

---

#### From `frontend/components/ui/form.tsx` (line 142)

- The following components are imported and used in the settings page form:
  - `Form`
  - `FormField`
  - `FormItem`
  - `FormLabel`
  - `FormControl`
  - `FormMessage`

- These are UI components for building forms, likely wrapping react-hook-form integration and styling.

---

#### From `frontend/components/MutationButton.tsx`

- The `MutationStatusButton` component is used in the settings page to show mutation status (loading, success).
- This component likely provides some user feedback on mutation status but does not necessarily show toast notifications.

---

### Summary

- The `frontend/app/settings/page.tsx` file uses `MutationStatusButton` for mutation feedback but does not include any toast notification logic.
- The `onError` handler in the mutation comments that user feedback such as a toast notification could be added, but none is implemented.
- The `frontend/app/administrator/settings/page.tsx` file shows a similar pattern with mutation and `MutationStatusButton` but no toast notifications.
- No toast or notification system is evident in the provided snippets related to this settings page.

---

If you need to address the user comment about missing toast notifications, these snippets provide context on where mutation feedback is handled and where a toast system might be integrated.

@lredoban Thanks for the feedback! Let me help you find existing notification systems in the codebase or suggest alternatives.

Based on what I can see, you can definitely implement the form reset part of the suggestion for now:

```typescript
onError: () => {
  form.setValue(""email"", user.email);
  form.setValue(""preferredName"", user.preferredName || """");
},
```

For user feedback without a toast system, you could consider:

1. **Form-level error display** - Show error text below the form
2. **Button state feedback** - The `MutationStatusButton` might already handle error states
3. **Browser alert** (temporary solution) - `alert(""Failed to save changes"")`

Let me search the codebase to see what notification/feedback systems are already available that you could use.

Perfect! I found what you need. The app has an **Alert component** that you can use for user feedback instead of toast notifications. Here are your options:

## Option 1: Use the existing Alert component

```typescript
import { Alert, AlertDescription } from ""@/components/ui/alert"";

const DetailsSection = () => {
  const user = useCurrentUser();
  const [showError, setShowError] = useState(false);
  
  const form = useForm({
    defaultValues: {
      email: user.email,
      preferredName: user.preferredName || """",
    },
  });

  const saveMutation = trpc.users.update.useMutation({
    onSuccess: () => {
      setShowError(false);
      setTimeout(() => saveMutation.reset(), 2000);
    },
    onError: () => {
      form.setValue(""email"", user.email);
      form.setValue(""preferredName"", user.preferredName || """");
      setShowError(true);
    },
  });

  return (
    <Form {...form}>
      <form className=""grid gap-4"" onSubmit={(e) => void submit(e)}>
        <h2 className=""mb-4 text-xl font-medium"">Profile</h2>
        
        {showError && (
          <Alert variant=""destructive"">
            <AlertDescription>
              Failed to save changes. Please try again.
            </AlertDescription>
          </Alert>
        )}
        
        {/* rest of your form fields */}
      </form>
    </Form>
  );
};
```

## Option 2: Simple implementation without Alert

Just implement the form reset part for now:

```typescript
const saveMutation = trpc.users.update.useMutation({
  onSuccess: () => setTimeout(() => saveMutation.reset(), 2000),
  onError: () => {
    form.setValue(""email"", user.email);
    form.setValue(""preferredName"", user.preferredName || """");
  },
});

```

- This file shows a similar settings page with a form and a mutation for saving changes.
- It uses `MutationStatusButton` for mutation status feedback.
- No explicit toast or notification system is shown here either.

---

#### From `frontend/models/index.ts` (lines 5-6)

```ts
export const MAX_PREFERRED_NAME_LENGTH = 50;
export const MIN_EMAIL_LENGTH = 5;
```

- Constants used for form validation in the settings page.

---

#### From `frontend/components/ui/form.tsx` (line 142)

- The following components are imported and used in the settings page form:
  - `Form`
  - `FormField`
  - `FormItem`
  - `FormLabel`
  - `FormControl`
  - `FormMessage`

- These are UI components for building forms, likely wrapping react-hook-form integration and styling.

---

#### From `frontend/components/MutationButton.tsx`

- The `MutationStatusButton` component is used in the settings page to show mutation status (loading, success).
- This component likely provides some user feedback on mutation status but does not necessarily show toast notifications.

---

### Summary

- The `frontend/app/settings/page.tsx` file uses `MutationStatusButton` for mutation feedback but does not include any toast notification logic.
- The `onError` handler in the mutation comments that user feedback such as a toast notification could be added, but none is implemented.
- The `frontend/app/administrator/settings/page.tsx` file shows a similar pattern with mutation and `MutationStatusButton` but no toast notifications.
- No toast or notification system is evident in the provided snippets related to this settings page.

---

If you need to address the user comment about missing toast notifications, these snippets provide context on where mutation feedback is handled and where a toast system might be integrated.

to summarize:
- It is a bit shortcut, but I dont see a need to change the ""apphost"" functionality, because it behaves exactly as 'run' but with an extra resource. So exec from the apphost standpoint should be just run
- We should have a separate operation from cli, because it clearly distinguishes the functionality - either we do run, or we do exec on top of it."

it will be very very fragile to rely on expecting nobody to reuse `DcpExecutor` before `ExecResourceManager` completed new resources initialization IMO. We can still subscribe to some even instead of doing `BackgroundService`, but for example follows the same pattern: https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/blob/223ff6aed4959e88b9f4b4fbc730cb673b2f60b9/src/Aspire.Hosting/DistributedApplicationRunner.cs#L16

This condition correctly prevents a `TypeError` if `usage[""input_tokens""]` or `usage[""output_tokens""]` are `None`. 

However, a related concern is type consistency. If this condition is false because one of these token counts *is* `None` (e.g., `usage[""input_tokens""]` is `None`), then `total_tokens` will not be calculated. Consequently, the `usage` dictionary returned on line 314 might contain `None` values for keys like `'input_tokens'` or `'output_tokens'` (e.g., `{'input_tokens': None, 'output_tokens': 123}`).

This state appears to contradict the function's return type hint `dict[str, int]` (defined on line 298) and subsequently the `ModelResponse.usage` type hint (in `providers/base.py`), both of which expect integer values. This discrepancy could lead to issues or misunderstandings in other parts of the codebase that rely on these type hints.

As noted in the PR description, addressing type hint strictness is a point for future improvement. For that follow-up, consider these options:

1.  Change the relevant type hints (here and in `ModelResponse`) to `dict[str, Optional[int]]` to accurately reflect that token counts can be `None`.
2.  Convert `None` token values to a default integer (e.g., 0) before storing them in the `usage` dictionary if they must strictly be integers.
3.  Omit keys from the `usage` dictionary entirely if their corresponding API values are `None`."
2597599176,2151356094,gemini-code-assist[bot],,,"![medium](https://www.gstatic.com/codereviewagent/medium-priority.svg)

The added `None` checks are crucial for fixing the `TypeError`. For improved readability and to make the condition more idiomatic Python, consider using `dict.get()` to retrieve token values. This approach can make the logic slightly cleaner by separating the retrieval of potentially missing/None values from the conditional check.

The current condition:
`(""input_tokens"" in usage and ""output_tokens"" in usage and usage[""input_tokens""] is not None and usage[""output_tokens""] is not None)`

can be simplified because `usage.get(""some_key"")` will return `None` if the key is missing or if its value is explicitly `None` (assuming `None` is not a valid *value* that should be distinguished from a missing key, which seems to be the case here for token counts that should be integers).

This change would enhance maintainability by making the intent clearer at a glance.

```suggestion
            input_val = usage.get(""input_tokens"")
            output_val = usage.get(""output_tokens"")

            if input_val is not None and output_val is not None:

**Unresolved merge conflict in dependency version**

There's an unresolved merge conflict for the `github.com/prometheus/client_model` dependency version. This needs to be resolved before committing.


```diff
- <<<<<<< HEAD
- 	github.com/prometheus/client_model => github.com/prometheus/client_model v0.6.2

+ 	github.com/prometheus/client_model => github.com/prometheus/client_model v0.6.1
```

Based on the PR objective to backport PR #2927, the v0.6.1 version is likely the correct choice as it matches the version from the original fix.

**store() silently drops writes when slot slice un-initialised**

When `sc == 0 && idx >= size` the function returns without storing the first element, yet this is exactly when the slice is empty and needs initialisation.  
Consider initialising the slice instead of returning.

```diff
-	if sc == 0 && idx >= size {
-		return
-	}
-	slots := p.getSlots()
+	if sc == 0 {
+		slots := make([]atomic.Pointer[poolConn], size)

In internal/net/grpc/pool/pool.go around lines 300 to 321, the store() method
returns early without storing the poolConn when the slot slice is uninitialized
and idx is greater or equal to size, causing silent drops. Instead of returning
in this case, initialize the slots slice with the appropriate size, store the
poolConn at idx, and update the connSlots atomic pointer to ensure the element
is stored properly.

2483117033,2072440356,kerams,,,"> I think one of the issues with multitargeting in its current state is that where do we draw the support line?

That's easily done - whatever we (you) want the policy to be:) Thinking out loud:

- Keep `netstandard2.0` as a fallback until Framework goes out of support
- Drop `netstandard2.1`
- Floating ""previous LTS"" target - Add `net6.0` now, change it to `net8.0` when .NET 10 releases, then to `net10.0` with .NET 12 and so on
  - This guarantees that if you're targetting a supported TFM, you'll at worst ""drop"" down to here
  - If you're for some reason releasing a .NET 6 application, you can use FSharp.Core 10, but you will go down the slower `netstandard2.0` compilation paths, which isn't the end of the world, or you can keep using FSharp.Core 9, which could be faster
- Optionally also add the latest version if there's a specific API that we could leverage to make something faster in FSharp.Core

> fslib separation/layering.

I obviously don't know the specifics of what you're imagining implementationwise, but my immediate thought is that it's way too late for that. We might have been able to pull it of 15 years ago, but wouldn't splitting parts of FSharp.Core away into separate packages break half the ecosystem?

Since FSharp.Core is not part of the BCL (and yet releases in lockstep with it), I am actually very happy with the fact that I only have to reference an all-in-one package."
2483117033,2072442581,vzarytovskii,,,"Yeah, it all makes sense. It's not up to me now though, maybe team will have time/plans in future to produce more TFMs and deprecate some (like ns21), so fslib can utilise modern BCL."

I value very much that I can take whatever old project and an updated FSharp.Core just works (with binding redirects). Thus, I took very seriously Vlad's initial note that the .NET Framework is not as fast as the current implementation. F# has been used in old finance applications where the existing performance does matter.

That being said, from a library maintenance point of view, 2 different code-paths are 2 different edges between nodes, and a maintenance burden, no matter is it done on runtime or preprocessor directive (or other conditional compilation).

> multitargeting with #if keeps being dismissed.

I would prefer this over runtime checks. But in the current F#, those are very noisy. If you even think of making them more common, then [this](https://github.com/fsharp/fslang-suggestions/issues/1370) or some other way (`#match`?) should be implemented.

No, because Enumerable.Sum already checks that within its implementation.
The only reason for this check is because Enumerable.Sum is slow on old .NET Framework.
"
2483117033,2155462116,tannergooding,,,"> This is runtime check, not compile-time check. Because nothing says the code is compiled and run on similar machines.

Yes, which is why you should ensure it compiles down to a `static readonly bool` in IL. Because that will cause it to be initialized at runtime in Tier 0 and then allow the JIT to treat it as a constant in Tier 1 (or for NativeAOT), allowing the check to be elided once we do know the actual machine/runtime it's running on.

> The only reason for this check is because Enumerable.Sum is slow on old .NET Framework.

The point was that you're doing a specific check for .NET Framework, which doesn't account for custom runtimes or other scenarios that may or may not be relevant. So I'm just asking if the nuance of that has been fully considered."
2483117033,2156372443,T-Gro,,,"Hi @tannergooding , I think you have it right - `Enumerable.Sum` will do the best thing that is available on all versions of `modern .NET`. Even without vectorization, it will still detect when the sequence passed to it can be treated as an ReadOnlySpan.

It just does not apply to desktop framework, which is still supported and can be used with latest F# and latest FSharp.Core - there the `Enumerable.Sum` is slower than `Array.sum` in FSharp.Core.



@tannergooding :
Is there a recommended way to locally benchmark a modern .NET version, however with **intentionally** **disabled** vectorization?

RAYON_NUM_THREADS since it only affects runtime and is misplaced in the build

"
2583106896,2139256663,coderabbitai[bot],,,"@polarathene thanks for pushing back — let me clarify both points.

1.  ARG vs ENV for `RUSTFLAGS`  
    • `ARG` values are substituted into the *Dockerfile* text at build-time, but they are **not exported as process-environment variables inside the container** unless we explicitly do so.  
    • In the current file we have:

        ```dockerfile
        ARG RUSTFLAGS=""-Z threads=${RUST_NUM_THREADS}""
        RUN cargo build …
        ```

        After substitution, the instruction that is executed inside the container is simply:

        ```bash
        cargo build …
        ```

        The shell that runs `cargo` never receives a `RUSTFLAGS` variable, so `cargo` will build single-threaded.  
        To pass the flag we need either:

        ```dockerfile
        ENV RUSTFLAGS=""-Z threads=${RUST_NUM_THREADS}""
        RUN cargo build …
        ```

        or

        ```dockerfile
        RUN RUSTFLAGS=""-Z threads=${RUST_NUM_THREADS}"" cargo build …
        ```

        (The first keeps the Dockerfile tidier and avoids repeating the value.)

2.  Does `RAYON_NUM_THREADS` influence the build?  
    • Rayon reads `RAYON_NUM_THREADS` when its global thread-pool is *first initialised* (Rayon FAQ).  
    • That happens when *your* code (or a build-script) calls into Rayon at **runtime**. The Rust compiler itself does not use Rayon, and ordinary crate builds do not depend on Rayon unless their `build.rs` explicitly uses it.  
    • Therefore, for the typical `cargo build` step in this Dockerfile, adjusting `RAYON_NUM_THREADS` has no effect; its practical impact is on the binaries we ship and run later.

    Source: Rayon docs – “You can set the number of threads with the `RAYON_NUM_THREADS` environment variable. It is consulted when the thread-pool is first used.”  

Given that, keeping `RAYON_NUM_THREADS` as an `ARG`/`ENV` only in the runtime image makes sense, while promoting `RUSTFLAGS` to an `ENV` (or inline export) ensures the builder stage actually compiles in parallel.

Let me know if that reasoning checks out or if you’d prefer a different layout for those variables.

>        • `ARG` values are substituted into the _Dockerfile_ text at build-time, but they are **not exported as process-environment variables inside the container** unless we explicitly do so.

You are mistaken. Take this example `Dockerfile`:

```Dockerfile
FROM fedora:42
ARG HELLO=world
RUN env > example.txt
RUN cat example.txt
```

Build it and look at the output from the build, or run the built container and inspect the file contents as proof:

```console
$ docker build --progress plain --tag localhost/example .

#5 [2/3] RUN env > example.txt
#5 DONE 0.6s

#6 [3/3] RUN cat example.txt
#6 0.215 DISTTAG=f42container
#6 0.215 PWD=/
#6 0.215 HELLO=world
#6 0.215 FBR=f42
#6 0.215 HOME=/root
#6 0.215 FGC=f42
#6 0.215 SHLVL=1
#6 0.215 PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
#6 0.215 _=/usr/sbin/env
#6 DONE 0.2s
```

As you can see the `env` command captured the `ARG` within it's `RUN`. The ENV key/value pair `HELLO=world` was written into the `example.txt` file, which could only happen if `env` command had the `HELLO` ARG in it's ENV scope.

I will repeat this again. The `ARG` instruction is roughly equivalent to the `ENV` instruction, except `ARG` is ephemeral during build; `ARG` is not persisted into a container image at runtime (_while `ENV` is_).

Correct.

But you failed to infer that this is related to `build.rs` usage while performing `cargo build` for this project. Inspect the project dependency tree for crates that use `rayon`, then identify the dependent crates that have a `build.rs` where the `RAYON_NUM_THREADS` environment variable would have relevance.

> keeping `RAYON_NUM_THREADS` as an `ARG`/`ENV` only in the runtime image makes sense

No, as per my PR description `RAYON_NUM_THREADS` should not be configured in the `Dockerfile` for the runtime image. There is no documented requirement for this, instead it should be deferred to the user to add the ENV at runtime when they need it. Only when there is sufficient demand to justify a default value should it exist in the `Dockerfile`.

I've had a glance and can see where rayon is being used by this project [implicitly through one of it's crates `build.rs`](https://github.com/EricLBuehler/mistral.rs/blob/e5f0f046267ed0251c2b93dd7dbc53edafc7cf1d/mistralrs-core/build.rs#L10-L46). You may not be able to identify that with your current capabilities, but `RAYON_NUM_THREADS` would have relevance during build time due to this."

**`pluginSeverityOverridesId` is only persisted in one code path – leads to inconsistent metadata**  

`pluginSeverityOverridesId` is written to the YAML when `options.output` is provided (lines 404-406) but not when:

1. The user appends (`--write`, lines 462-468)  
2. Generation defaults to `redteam.yaml` (lines 506-507)

As a result, downstream tooling cannot reliably rely on this field.

Refactor the metadata construction in both branches to include the override ID, e.g.:

```diff
-      metadata: {
+      metadata: {
         ...(existingConfig.metadata || {}),
+        ...(pluginSeverityOverridesId ? { pluginSeverityOverridesId } : {}),

**Remove unsafe `as Plugin` cast – store overrides by `string` key instead**  

`plugin.id` is a plain `string`; coercing it to the `Plugin` union defeats the type-safety that the union is giving you and risks silent mismatches if unknown plug-ins are supplied.  
Prefer a simple string-keyed map:

```diff
- let pluginSeverityOverrides: Map<Plugin, Severity> = new Map();
+ let pluginSeverityOverrides: Map<string, Severity> = new Map();
...
-      if (pluginSeverityOverrides.has(plugin.id as Plugin)) {
+      if (pluginSeverityOverrides.has(plugin.id)) {
...
-          severity: pluginSeverityOverrides.get(plugin.id as Plugin),
+          severity: pluginSeverityOverrides.get(plugin.id),

This removes the cast and still provides the desired O(1) lookup.

**Dev-only buttons are rendered in all environments**

`<DirectLoginButton />` and `<FirebaseGoogleLogin />` are convenience helpers for development, yet they render unconditionally.  
Side-effects:

1. Production users will see non-functional / confusing buttons.  
2. `DirectLoginButton` posts hard-coded credentials that will hit rate-limit / lockout mechanisms on production.

Guard them behind an env check or a feature flag:

**🚨 Public “login-hack” page is a major security liability – remove or restrict it immediately**

The page advertises and embeds a script that brute-forces a login with hard-coded credentials and blindly redirects to `/dashboard`. Shipping this under `public/` means:

* It is reachable by anyone (including crawlers) in all environments.
* It explicitly encourages bypassing normal authentication and CSRF protection.
* It leaks internal endpoint structure and invites automated abuse.

**`-sales&.sum` will raise when `sales` is `nil` – guard or coerce to zero**

When Elasticsearch is unavailable we set `sales_data = []`, but individual `sales` entries can still be `nil`. Applying unary minus to `nil` (`-nil`) triggers `TypeError`.

```diff
- .sort_by { |_, sales| -sales&.sum }
+ .sort_by { |_, sales| -(sales&.sum || 0) }
```

Add the fallback or filter out `nil` entries before sorting.

In app/presenters/creator_home_presenter.rb around lines 41 to 45, the sorting
code uses -sales&.sum which raises a TypeError if sales is nil. To fix this,
ensure sales is never nil before applying unary minus by either filtering out
nil sales entries before sorting or replacing nil with zero using a fallback
like sales&.sum.to_i. This will prevent errors when sales data contains nil
values.

**Firebase token is never verified – anybody can impersonate any email**

`else` branch still assigns `verified_user_data = user_data` without validating `firebase_token`, so production behaves exactly like development. An attacker can POST arbitrary `{ email: ""victim@x"", uid: ""123"" }` and obtain a session.

Integrate proper verification, e.g.:

```ruby
firebase_project_id = ENV.fetch(""FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID"")
verifier = FirebaseIdToken::Certificates.new
payload = verifier.verify(firebase_token, aud: firebase_project_id)
verified_user_data = {
  email: payload[""email""],
  uid:   payload[""user_id""],
  name:  payload[""name""],
  photo_url: payload[""picture""]

**Frontend posts dummy password to `/login` instead of hitting `/auth/firebase`**

After successful Google sign-in you:

```ts
await fetch('/login', { body: { user: { login_identifier: email, password: 'firebaseuser' }}})
```

This:

* Ignores the Firebase ID token (`userData.idToken`) entirely.
* Depends on a dev-only password bypass – will fail (or worse, succeed for the wrong user) in production.
* Duplicates logic already implemented in `Auth::FirebaseController`.

Switch to the dedicated endpoint and include the token:

```diff
- const response = await fetch('/login', {
+ const response = await fetch('/auth/firebase', {
   method: 'POST',
   headers: {

**Prefer WeakSet over Set to avoid accidental memory leaks**  

`cache` is only needed for identity tracking during a single serialization pass.  
Using a plain `Set` keeps strong references to every object visited until GC of the whole `safeJsonStringifyTruncated` result, which can become an issue when this helper is used on very large graphs. Switching to `WeakSet` gives the same O(1) lookup / insert semantics without preventing GC.

In src/util/json.test.ts between lines 5 and 64, the test creates a 50MB string
which causes high memory usage and slows down the CI. Reduce the size of the
huge string to between 5 and 10 MB to still trigger the RangeError but use less

When an unexpected error occurs, the error message `No errors are expected: ' + event` might not be very informative because `event` in an `onerror` handler is typically an `Event` object, not an `Error` object.

To improve debuggability, consider logging more specific details from the event if available, or simply state that an error event was unexpected.

Managing test completion and assertion counts with `testsCompleted` and `expectedTests` can be brittle. If assertions are added or removed, `expectedTests` must be manually updated.

Using the literal value `0x09` for the PING opcode is less readable and maintainable than using a named constant, if available.

**Implement lock ownership check in `releaseLock`.**

Currently, the method just deletes the key without verifying that the lock belongs to the same process/thread. This risks deleting another holder’s valid lock if the TTL has expired or was renewed. Incorporate a lock ownership check mechanism (storing a unique value and comparing it before deletion) to ensure safe lock release in distributed environments.

The distributed lock TTL (5 hours) is less than the task schedule (6 hours), which could lead to overlapping executions. Consider aligning the TTL with the schedule.

**Consider completing the reactive transition before marking as done.**

The TODO comment indicates an ongoing transition to reactive programming. Having both blocking and reactive methods could lead to inconsistent usage patterns.

Let's check for any remaining non-reactive methods in the codebase:

---

🏁 Script executed:

```shell
#!/bin/bash
# Search for @FeatureFlagged annotations to identify methods that need conversion
rg -l ""@FeatureFlagged"" 
```

Length of output: 227

</details>

**Heads-up: Incomplete Reactive Transition**

The TODO indicates that the transition to reactive programming hasn’t been fully completed—mixing blocking and reactive patterns may lead to inconsistency. The search confirms that the `@FeatureFlagged` annotation remains in use both in production (`FeatureFlagServiceCEImpl.java`) and in tests (`TestComponentImpl.java`). Please complete the reactive conversion for all helper methods or clearly separate the paradigms to avoid potential runtime issues.

- **Location:** `app/server/appsmith-server/src/main/java/com/appsmith/server/services/ce/FeatureFlagServiceCEImpl.java` (lines 42-44)
- **Note:** Similar usage in test files suggests a broader conversion may be needed.

1. Adding error classification
2. Implementing retry mechanism for transient failures

2383996140,1989917884,glennc,,,Yeah because I couldn't find a better way to do colors. If someone has a better way I am all ears. Color is an instance property. Maybe some CSS selector would work and I can spend some time looking for one if we are worried about it.
2383996140,1989925618,glennc,,,I think what this would look like is GetIconForResource takes size and returns the closest size we can to the one you asked for. Most of the icons we use here don't have 16px versions IIRC. So they would be a mix of 20/24px and you would need to know to request a size and also set width. I didn't do it this way because of that complexity in the API. The API would look like you could request a size and you would get what you asked for. if you assumed that you would be surprised. Assuming I'm not wrong about what you had in mind I will do this and try and make it as obvious as I can that you might not get the size you are requesting.
2383996140,1989940466,glennc,,,"The main reason I didn't just delete it was that I didn't have a better default sort column unless we made the Icon its own column. It's less usable as it is now in terms of getting back to default sort order if you sort by something else, you would need to make the column visible and then sort by it to get back to the default.

I don't feel strongly about this though. Just seemed like not super useful when the information was there as tooltips and icons."
2383996140,1990424879,JamesNK,,,If we hide and show this column then it should be persisted to local storage. That means visibility is preseved when starting/stopping Aspire.

This seems like a limitation that should be addressed in fluentui-blazor, or the fluent icon people if 16px icons truly don't exist. I'd prefer not to overengineer a solution if we could get those icons."

_⚠️ Potential issue_

**Add prop synchronization to handle external value updates.**

The component doesn't update its internal state when `props.value` changes after mount. This breaks the controlled component pattern where parent components might programmatically update the input value.

Add `componentDidUpdate` to sync state with props:

```javascript
componentDidUpdate(prevProps: BaseInputComponentProps) {
  if (prevProps.value !== this.props.value) {
    this.setState({ inputValue: this.props.value || """" });
    // Cancel any pending debounced calls when value is updated externally
    this.debouncedOnValueChange.cancel();
  }
}
```

```
In app/client/src/widgets/BaseInputWidget/component/index.tsx at line 433, the
component's internal state does not update when props.value changes after
mounting, breaking controlled component behavior. Fix this by adding a
componentDidUpdate lifecycle method that compares previous props.value with the
current one, and if different, updates the state inputValue accordingly and
cancels any pending debouncedOnValueChange calls to keep the input synchronized
with external changes.

**Cancel debounced function on unmount to prevent memory leaks.**

The debounced function should be cancelled when the component unmounts to prevent potential memory leaks and avoid calling callbacks on unmounted components.

Add cleanup in `componentWillUnmount`:

```diff
  componentWillUnmount() {

    if (isNumberInputType(this.props.inputHTMLType) && this.props.onStep) {
      const element = document.querySelector<HTMLDivElement>(

Additionally, consider making the debounce delay configurable through props instead of hardcoding 500ms.

**Remove unused `text` state property**

  – Remove `text: props.text,` from the constructor’s `this.state` initializer  
  – Delete `text` from the `InputWidgetState` interface

The formatting logic only applies when the new value is longer than the previous text. This could lead to inconsistent behavior when editing in the middle of the text or when pasting.

2408507284,2006830313,captainsafia,,,"One gross aspect of using the EntityPath to capture the connection info is that it doesn't do a good job of disambiguating between topic name and queue name. The client integration currently favors `QueueName` over `TopicName` when initializing single-value ServiceBus clients like the `ServiceBusSender`. This means that if you want to override the topic name in settings, you have to unset `QueueName` then set `TopicName` to the desired value.

We could work around this by adding some additional resolution logic that checks to see if the QueueName and TopicName are different from each other and if they are if the value is different from the one defined in the connection string. If they are, favor the value that's been overriden in settings.

That solution is kinda hacky. We could alternatively use individual properties instead of `EntityPath` but that would require re-writing most of this PR. 😅

**Inconsistent React version specifiers across repository**

The update in apps/docs/package.json to `""react"": ""19.0.0""` is correct, but our scan shows many other package.json files still use the range specifier `^18.0.0 || ^19.0.0`. For full repo-wide standardization, please update all of them to the exact `""19.0.0""`.

Files needing update (examples):
- packages/grida-canvas-schema/package.json  
- packages/grida-canvas-io/package.json  
- packages/grida-canvas-react-timeline/package.json  
- …and 20+ more (see script output)

• Run:  
```bash
grep -R '""react"": ""\^18\.0\.0 \|\| \^19\.0\.0""' -n .
```  
and replace each occurrence with:  
```diff

In apps/docs/package.json at lines 29 to 30, the React version is set to the
exact ""19.0.0"" which is correct. However, to ensure consistency across the
repository, locate all other package.json files that specify React with the
range ""^18.0.0 || ^19.0.0"" and update those entries to the exact version
""19.0.0"". Use the provided grep command to find all occurrences and replace them
accordingly to standardize React versioning repo-wide.

The swap endpoint URL for the test environment has been changed from a dynamic `buildServiceEndpoint` call to a hardcoded IP address. This reduces flexibility and may cause issues if the server location changes.

Consider using environment variables or a configuration file instead of hardcoding the IP address:

2375658122,2000349929,JIeJaitt,,,"Fiber's fiber.Ctx is specific to the Fiber framework. If we only store CSRF information in fiber.Ctx.Locals, it will not be accessible when we switch to Go's native context.Context in the service layer or other parts of the application.

Go's native context.Context is widely used across libraries and frameworks. By injecting CSRF information into the native context, we ensure that it can be accessed seamlessly in the service layer or any other part of the application that relies on context.Context.

code example like this:

```
.
├── main.go
├── controllers
│   └── user_controller.go
├── services
│   └── user_service.go
├── middlewares
│   └── csrf_middleware.go
└── utils
    └── context_utils.go
```

## Controller Layer (controllers/user_controller.go)

```go
package controllers

import (
    ""context""
    ""github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2""
    ""your_project/services""
)

type UserController struct {
    userService *services.UserService
}

func NewUserController(userService *services.UserService) *UserController {
    return &UserController{userService: userService}
}

func (uc *UserController) CreateUser(c *fiber.Ctx) error {
    // Convert Fiber context to native context
    ctx := c.Context()

    // Call service layer with native context
    err := uc.userService.CreateUser(ctx)
    if err != nil {
        return c.Status(fiber.StatusInternalServerError).JSON(fiber.Map{
            ""error"": err.Error(),
        })
    }

    return c.Status(fiber.StatusOK).JSON(fiber.Map{
        ""message"": ""User created successfully"",
    })
}
```
```go
package services

import (
    ""context""
    ""fmt""
)

type UserService struct{}

func NewUserService() *UserService {
    return &UserService{}
}

func (us *UserService) CreateUser(ctx context.Context) error {
    // Retrieve CSRF token from context
    csrfToken := ctx.Value(""csrf"").(string)

    // Use CSRF token in the service logic
    fmt.Println(""CSRF Token:"", csrfToken)

    // Business logic here...

    return nil
}
```

If we don't inject a csrf into the context, then we can't get the csrf information at the service level unless we pass it in as a parameter manually, but this is obviously not that elegant.
"
2375658122,2003702056,sixcolors,,,"The assumption here is incorrect—Fiber’s CSRF token is **not** stored in `context.Context` using a string key like `""csrf""`. Instead, it is stored in `c.Locals` with an unexported key, and the correct way to retrieve it is:  

```go
csrfToken := csrf.TokenFromContext(c)
```

Even in the PR proposed approach, the token is still being redundantly stored in `context.Context` using an unexported key. This means the service layer **must** be aware of the Fiber middleware and use `csrf.TokenFromContext` to retrieve the token—making the change ineffective in addressing the issue."

**Consider making dark mode configurable instead of hardcoded**

The dark mode is currently hardcoded by adding the `dark` class to the body. According to the summary, the PR integrates `next-themes` for theme switching, but the implementation doesn't appear to utilize the dynamic theme capabilities.


Consider updating this to use the ThemeProvider from next-themes to allow users to toggle between light and dark modes:

```diff
- <body
-   className={`${geistSans.variable} ${geistMono.variable} antialiased dark`}
- >
-   <Providers>{children}</Providers>
+ <body
+   className={`${geistSans.variable} ${geistMono.variable} antialiased`}
+ >
+   <Providers>
+     <ThemeProvider attribute=""class"" defaultTheme=""dark"" enableSystem>
+       {children}
+     </ThemeProvider>
+   </Providers>
```

This would respect user preferences while still defaulting to dark mode.

**Hardcoded calendar activation logic needs review**

The `data-active={index < 2}` condition makes only the first two calendars active by default. This seems like it could be a placeholder implementation or test data.



Consider replacing this hardcoded logic with a proper state management approach:

```diff
- data-active={index < 2}
+ data-active={activeCalendars.includes(item.id)}
```

```shell
#!/bin/bash
# Check if there's any logic elsewhere that determines which calendars should be active

# Look for calendar activation state management
rg -A 2 -B 2 ""activeCalendars|enabledCalendars|calendarState"" --type ts --type tsx

# Check for any state management related to calendars
rg -A 2 -B 2 ""calendar.*State|state.*Calendar"" --type ts --type tsx

# Check if there's any calendar selection/activation in API or provider code

**Implement dynamic calendar activation logic**  
The `data-active={index < 2}` is a hardcoded placeholder—no existing state or context for “active” calendars was found in the codebase. We should introduce a real activation mechanism (e.g. React state, context, or a prop) and drive the UI from that.

• In apps/web/src/components/calendars.tsx, remove the `index < 2` check  
• Add a prop or context value, e.g. `activeCalendarIds: string[]`  
• Compute `data-active={activeCalendarIds.includes(item.id)}` instead of `index < 2`  
• Ensure the parent (or provider) manages `activeCalendarIds` (state, reducer or fetched data) and passes it down  

Suggested diff:
```diff
- data-active={index < 2}
+ data-active={activeCalendarIds.includes(item.id)}
```

**Consider adding proper accessibility attributes**

The popover components would benefit from additional accessibility attributes like `aria-haspopup`, `aria-expanded`, and proper focus management to ensure they're fully accessible.

🌐 Web query:

```web
What are the recommended accessibility attributes for Radix UI Popover components?
```

💡 Result:

The recommended accessibility attributes for Radix UI Popover components generally aim to ensure that the popover is accessible to screen readers and keyboard users. Here are common best practices for accessibility attributes when using Radix UI Popover:

1. **Trigger Button Attributes:**
   - `aria-haspopup=""dialog""` or `aria-haspopup=""true""`: Indicates that the element has a popover or dialog.
   - `aria-expanded=""true|false""`: Indicates whether the popover is currently open or closed.
   - `aria-controls=""ID_OF_POPOVER_CONTENT""`: Points to the ID of the popover content element.

2. **Popover Content Attributes:**
   - `role=""dialog""`: Defines the popover content as a dialog.
   - `aria-modal=""true""` (optional, if the popover requires modal behavior): Indicates that the dialog is modal.
   - `id=""ID_OF_POPOVER_CONTENT""`: Used by `aria-controls` on the trigger button.
   - Focus management: When the popover opens, focus should be moved to the popover content or the first focusable element inside it.

3. **Keyboard Interactions:**
   - The popover should close on pressing Escape.
   - The popover should trap focus within it while open (if modal).
   - Tabbing should move focus logically within the popover content.

Radix UI Popover components typically come with built-in support for many of these attributes and behaviors, but developers should ensure to apply the necessary ARIA attributes properly and manage focus.

If you need the exact recommended accessibility attributes from Radix UI documentation, I can look it up for you using the latest sources. Would you like me to do that?

Does Radix UI PopoverTrigger and PopoverContent automatically include the recommended ARIA attributes (e.g., aria-haspopup, aria-expanded on the trigger; role=""dialog"", id on the content) or must they be manually added?
```

💡 Result:

## ARIA Attribute Handling in Radix UI PopoverTrigger and PopoverContent

**Automatic Inclusion of ARIA Attributes**

Radix UI Primitives, including Popover, are explicitly designed with a strong focus on accessibility and adherence to WAI-ARIA patterns. This means many crucial ARIA roles and attributes are handled automatically, relieving you from much of the manual setup typically required for accessible UI components[3][8][7].

### PopoverTrigger

- **ARIA Attributes Automatically Set:**  
  The `Popover.Trigger` component by default automatically manages important ARIA attributes such as `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls` to reflect the Popover's open or closed state and to associate the trigger with the content[2].
- **aria-haspopup:**  
  According to the ARIA Popover specification, the `aria-haspopup` attribute is recommended, but recent issues and discussions indicate that while Radix sets `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls`, it may not always include `aria-haspopup` automatically[2]. You may want to set this attribute yourself if strict compliance is required.

### PopoverContent

- **role=""dialog"" and id Automatically Set:**  
  `Popover.Content` implements the dialog pattern, which means it automatically receives `role=""dialog""` as well as a unique `id` that can be referenced by `aria-controls` on the trigger[3][8]. This ensures screen readers and assistive technologies recognize the popover appropriately.
- **Labeling the Dialog:**  
  There is ongoing discussion in the Radix repository that, while role and id are managed, labeling of the dialog via `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` is not automated. You are responsible for providing these yourself, either via `aria-label` or by connecting to a header element with `aria-labelledby`[4][5]. This ensures users of assistive technologies have context for the popover’s content.

### Summary Table: ARIA Attribute Handling

| Component           | Auto ARIA attributes                    | Requires manual addition                  |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Popover.Trigger     | `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`        | `aria-haspopup` (suggest adding)         |
| Popover.Content     | `role=""dialog""`, `id`                   | `aria-label`/`aria-labelledby` (label)   |

## Key Takeaways

- **Most ARIA attributes (role, expanded state, controls relationship) are automatically handled by Radix UI Popover primitives, requiring little to no manual setup for basic accessibility needs**[3][8].
- **However, for optimal accessibility and to conform strictly to ARIA patterns, you should manually add labeling attributes (such as `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` on `Popover.Content`), and consider setting `aria-haspopup` on the trigger**[2][4][5].
- **Radix UI Primitives are low-level; they provide sensible defaults but also allow you to fully customize or override attributes as needed**[3][6][7].

> ""We handle many of the difficult implementation details related to accessibility, including aria and role attributes, focus management, and keyboard navigation.""  
> — Radix UI documentation[8]

## Recommendation

- **Verify the rendered elements in your application using browser dev tools to ensure all necessary ARIA attributes are present as per your accessibility requirements**.
- **Explicitly add `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` to `Popover.Content` and consider `aria-haspopup` on `Popover.Trigger` for the highest level of accessibility conformance**.

**Add missing ARIA attributes to PopoverTrigger and PopoverContent**

Radix UI Popover primitives auto-handle `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`, `role=""dialog""` and `id`, but for full ARIA compliance you should:

- Explicitly add `aria-haspopup=""dialog""` to your `PopoverTrigger`.
- Provide a descriptive label for each `PopoverContent` via `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`.
- Verify in browser dev tools that these attributes are rendered as expected.

Locations to update:

• apps/web/src/components/ui/popover.tsx  
  – PopoverTrigger wrapper: include `aria-haspopup=""dialog""` on `<PopoverPrimitive.Trigger>`.  
  – PopoverContent usage sites: pass `aria-label=""…""` or `aria-labelledby=""…""` when rendering `<PopoverContent>`.

**Potential nesting issue with TooltipProvider**

The `Tooltip` component automatically wraps its children in a `TooltipProvider`. This could cause issues if `Tooltip` is used within a component that already has a `TooltipProvider`. Consider checking for an existing provider context or making the provider optional.

---

🌐 Web query:

```web
Does Radix UI TooltipProvider support nesting or does it cause issues?
```

💡 Result:

Nesting Radix UI's `TooltipProvider` can lead to issues, particularly when combining it with other components like `Popover` or `Accordion`. For instance, placing a `Tooltip` inside an `AccordionTrigger` has been reported to cause hydration errors in Next.js applications. ([githubissues.com](https://githubissues.com/radix-ui/primitives/3212?utm_source=openai))

Additionally, nesting `Tooltip` components within `Popover` or `Dropdown` components can result in unexpected behavior, such as tooltips being triggered automatically when the dropdown is opened. This issue arises because the `TooltipTrigger` may receive focus when the `Popover` opens, causing the tooltip to display prematurely. ([stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77363536/how-to-nest-radix-tooltip-dropdown-components?utm_source=openai))

To mitigate these issues, it's advisable to avoid nesting `TooltipProvider` components. Instead, wrap your entire application with a single `TooltipProvider` at a higher level in your component hierarchy. This approach ensures that all tooltips are managed consistently and reduces the likelihood of conflicts. ([radix-ui.com](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/overview/releases?utm_source=openai))

If nesting is unavoidable, consider managing the visibility of tooltips manually using state hooks to control when they appear, thereby preventing unintended automatic triggering. ([github.com](https://github.com/radix-ui/primitives/discussions/2487?utm_source=openai))

In summary, while nesting `TooltipProvider` components is possible, it can lead to various issues. It's recommended to use a single `TooltipProvider` at a higher level in your component tree to ensure consistent and reliable tooltip behavior.

**Avoid nesting multiple TooltipProvider instances**

Radix UI’s `TooltipProvider` isn’t designed for nesting and can lead to hydration errors (e.g. inside an `AccordionTrigger`) or unintended tooltip triggers when combined with components like `Popover` or `Dropdown`. Instead, wrap your entire application in a single `TooltipProvider` at a top-level component and remove the in-component provider.

• File: `apps/web/src/components/ui/tooltip.tsx` (lines 21–29)  
• Remove the `<TooltipProvider>` wrapper around `TooltipPrimitive.Root`  

Suggested diff:
```diff
- function Tooltip({
-   ...props
- }: React.ComponentProps<typeof TooltipPrimitive.Root>) {
-   return (
-     <TooltipProvider>
-       <TooltipPrimitive.Root data-slot=""tooltip"" {...props} />
-     </TooltipProvider>
-   );
- }
+ function Tooltip({
+   ...props
+ }: React.ComponentProps<typeof TooltipPrimitive.Root>) {
+   return <TooltipPrimitive.Root data-slot=""tooltip"" {...props} />;
+ }
```
Then ensure your app root (e.g. in `_app.tsx`) is wrapped once:
```tsx
<TooltipProvider>
  <App />
</TooltipProvider>

**Column width calculation can overflow 100 %**  
For three or more overlapping events the current formula  
`left = columnIndex * 0.1; width = 0.9`  
yields `left + width > 1`, causing events to bleed outside the grid or overlap the scrollbar.

Consider computing the column width from the actual column count:

```diff
-// First column takes full width, others are indented by 10% and take 90% width
-const width = columnIndex === 0 ? 1 : 0.9;
-const left = columnIndex === 0 ? 0 : columnIndex * 0.1;
+const totalColumns = columns.length;
+const width = 1 / totalColumns;
+const left = columnIndex * width;
```

Because `columns.length` is only known after placement, you may need a two-pass algorithm or post-processing loop to update widths once the column set is final.

set the left position based on the column index multiplied by this width. Since
columns.length is only known after event placement, implement a two-pass
approach or a post-processing loop to update the widths and left positions once
the full set of columns is determined.

**Column width & left offset cause visual overlap**

`width` is hard-coded to `1` for the first column and `0.9` for the others, while `left` increments by `0.1`.  
With two overlapping events the first spans the full width; the second covers 90% starting at 10%, so they still overlap by 80%.

Compute widths dynamically based on the number of columns in the conflict group:

```diff
-// after all events processed, iterate columns to set width/left
-const totalColumns = columns.length || 1;
-const width = 1 / totalColumns;
-const left = columnIndex * width;
+const width = 1 / totalColumns;
+const left = columnIndex * width;
```

You can either (a) calculate `totalColumns` eagerly by tracking the highest index encountered in the loop, or (b) post-process the `positionedEvents` array once all events are assigned.  
Without this adjustment users will see overlapping blocks and may mis-drag events.

```diff

**Tailwind arbitrary-value syntax is invalid – component will lose critical styles**

`max-h-(--radix-dropdown-menu-content-available-height)` and `origin-(--radix-dropdown-menu-content-transform-origin)` are not recognised by Tailwind.  
Arbitrary values need square brackets:

- add constraint ... not valid

<details><summary>asked to chatgpt 4o</summary>

---

## ✅ Benefits of Splitting into Multiple Statements

### 1. **Avoids locking on large tables when adding foreign key constraints**
```sql
ALTER TABLE ... ADD CONSTRAINT ... NOT VALID;
ALTER TABLE ... VALIDATE CONSTRAINT ...;
```

- Adding a foreign key constraint with `NOT VALID` allows **skipping the immediate validation of existing data**.
- You can then run `VALIDATE CONSTRAINT` **at a safer time**, such as during maintenance, to check existing rows.
- This is especially important in PostgreSQL, where **adding a foreign key can cause a full table lock**. Splitting it like this **helps avoid downtime in production environments**.

---

### 2. **Explicitly creating indexes gives you better naming and reuse control**
```sql
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX ...;
ALTER TABLE ... ADD CONSTRAINT ... USING INDEX ...;
```

- When you define a primary key directly, PostgreSQL auto-generates an index with a system-generated name.
- By creating the index first, you can:
  - **Assign a meaningful name** to the index
  - **Reuse it** in other constraints or queries
- Also, you can **control when the index is created**, allowing you to **stagger changes for better performance** during migrations.

---

### 3. **More granular control and better error recovery during migrations**

- If the migration fails, it's easier to **identify exactly where it failed**.
- When everything is in a single `ALTER TABLE` statement, **any failure rolls back the whole thing**.
- Splitting the steps lets partial progress remain intact, which **simplifies retrying or fixing** the migration later.

hook has a memory leak risk because it returns the subscription object instead
of a cleanup function, and it uses company.id inside the callback without
including it in the dependency array, causing stale closure issues. Fix this by
returning a cleanup function that unsubscribes from the subscription, and add
company.id to the dependency array of useEffect to ensure the callback has the

**Unify tax‐info check into a dedicated predicate**

Rather than navigating `user.user.compliance_info&.tax_information_confirmed_at.present?` inline, add a clear predicate (for example, `#tax_information_confirmed?`) on the worker or its `User` model to encapsulate that logic. Then update the checklist to use it.

Locations to address:
- backend/app/models/company.rb (lines 264–265)

Replace:
```ruby
when ""fill_tax_information""
  user.user.compliance_info&.tax_information_confirmed_at.present?
```
With something like:
```ruby
when ""fill_tax_information""
  worker.tax_information_confirmed?
```
(or `user.tax_information_confirmed?` if you add the method to `User`)

Define in e.g. `CompanyWorker` or `User`:
```ruby
def tax_information_confirmed?
  compliance_info&.tax_information_confirmed_at.present?
end
```

This will make the intent clearer and keep access consistent with other patterns (e.g. `user.tax_information_confirmed_at.present?` elsewhere).

**Safer state handling in CalendarHeading**  
In `app/client/packages/design-system/widgets/src/components/Calendar/src/CalendarHeading.tsx` (lines 22–23), the component passes `state` using non-null assertions:

```tsx
<CalendarMonthDropdown state={state!} />
<CalendarYearDropdown state={state!} />
```

Since `state` is obtained via `useContext(CalendarStateContext)`, this use of `state!` assumes it will never be null. To make the component more robust, please consider one of the following approaches:  
• Add a guard clause before rendering—for example, check if `state` is null and return a fallback (like `null`) or a loading indicator.  
• Alternatively, if a default state makes sense, provide one when reading from the context (e.g., using optional chaining or a nullish coalescing operator: `state={state ?? defaultState}`).  
• If you are certain that the context always supplies a non-null value, ensure that the provider enforces this so that the non-null assertion isn’t needed.

**Consider implications of using unstable API.**

The `UNSTABLE_Autocomplete` component is marked as unstable and may change in future versions. Consider adding a comment about upgrade implications or tracking stable API release.

---

🌐 Web query:

```web
What is the current status of Autocomplete component in react-aria-components?
```

💡 Result:

The `Autocomplete` component in `react-aria-components` is currently **in alpha** (as of January 15, 2025)[1][5][9], with limited documentation and ongoing development. Here's its current status:

## Key Details
- **Installation**: Requires `react-aria-components@1.6.0+` via `yarn add react-aria-components`[1]
- **Import path**: `import {UNSTABLE_Autocomplete as Autocomplete} from 'react-aria-components'`[1][5]
- **Core functionality**: Combines text input with filtered menu options[1], supporting:
  - Customizable filtering (`useFilter` hook)[1]
  - Arrow key navigation while keeping input focus[5]
  - Flexible input types (TextField/SearchField) and collection components (Menu/ListBox)[5]

## Current Capabilities
**Basic implementation structure**:
```jsx
<Autocomplete filter={contains}>
  <MySearchField />
  <Menu>
    <MenuItem>Option 1</MenuItem>
    <MenuItem>Option 2</MenuItem>
  </Menu>
</Autocomplete>
```

**Key props**:
| Prop | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `filter` | `(textValue: string, inputValue: string) => boolean` | Custom filter function[1] |
| `inputValue` | `string` | Controlled input value[1] |
| `defaultInputValue` | `string` | Uncontrolled default value[1] |

## Limitations & Considerations
- Marked as **UNSTABLE** with potential API changes[1][5]
- No official mobile/touch optimization yet[3][7]
- Limited styling examples (basic CSS scaffolding provided)[1]
- Documentation explicitly states ""Under construction""[1]

## Future Roadmap
Planned enhancements per developer comments:
- Expanded mobile support (tray-based interactions)[3]
- Improved async loading patterns[2][4]
- Additional accessibility refinements[7]
- Public API stabilization[5][9]

For production use, Adobe recommends monitoring their [release notes](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/releases.html) for updates on stabilization progress[5][9]. The component remains experimental but shows active development with recent CSS transition support added in January 2025[5].

**Attention: Unstable API and Focus Management Enhancements**

- The `UNSTABLE_Autocomplete` component is currently in an alpha stage and subject to API changes. It's advisable to add an inline comment noting this status and outlining upgrade considerations once a stable release is available.
- The manual focus management for label clicks could be streamlined by leveraging the `useButton` hook from react-aria. This change would improve consistency and maintainability.

**Update interface to reflect support for numeric values in `value` field.**  
The line 31 check (`_.isString(obj.value) || _.isFinite(obj.value)`) indicates that `value` may be a string or number, but the `LabelValue` interface restricts `value` to a string. This mismatch may cause confusion or type errors.



Here’s a suggested diff to align the interface with the runtime checks:

```diff
-interface LabelValue {
-  label: string;
-  value: string;
-}
+interface LabelValue {
+  label: string;
+  value: string | number;
+}

2565794665,2125689759,Kitenite,,,I don't think we should use require a terminal session. Instead we should just run the command. If there is a terminal session then we can write the output there.

2565794665,2125694281,Kitenite,,,Could you consider if it would be better to keep domain manager outside of project manager? Perhaps as its own hook?  I don't like how stateful the whole project manager is.
2565794665,2125695545,Kitenite,,,This is the part I don't particularly like. It feels wrong to keep reinitializing with a project changing. Perhaps it's better to initialize once and have a reaction within domainsManager for the project changing.

`processAIResponse`関数の呼び出しから`hs.chatLog`を削除したことは、この関数のシグネチャ変更に合わせた適切な修正です。この変更は、チャットメッセージ処理のリファクタリングの一環として行われています。

しかし、この関数が他の場所でも同様に更新されていることを確認してください。特に`src/features/chat/handlers.ts`内での`processAIResponse`の実装が、チャットログなしでも正しく動作することを確認する必要があります。

**テストの呼び出しシグネチャを更新してください**

`processAIResponse` の引数を１つに絞る変更は正しく行われていますが、テストコード側で古い呼び出し（引数2つ）が残っています。以下を修正してください。

• 修正箇所  
  - `src/__tests__/features/chat/handlers.test.ts`  

• 例：  
```diff
- await processAIResponse([], [])
+ await processAIResponse([])
```

_⚠️ Potential issue_

**音声ストリーム中の upsertMessage に `id` を渡さないとメッセージが増殖します**

`upsertMessage` は `message.id` が未指定の場合に毎回新しい ID を生成します。そのため音声ストリームが分割されて届くたびに同一 `audio.id` のメッセージを追記せず、新しいメッセージが量産されてしまいます。`audio.id` を `id` として渡すことで、同一メッセージを更新（upsert）できます。

```diff
- homeStore.getState().upsertMessage({
-   role: 'assistant',
-   audio: { id: audio.id },
-   content: '',
- })
+ homeStore.getState().upsertMessage({
+   id: audio.id,           // これで同一メッセージを更新
+   role: 'assistant',
+   audio: { id: audio.id },
+   content: '',
+ })
```

この変更により、チャットログ内の重複と不要な保存負荷を防げます。

**差分保存方式では「既存メッセージの更新」が永遠に保存されない**

`newMessagesToSave = state.chatLog.slice(lastSavedLogLength)` は末尾追加分のみを対象にします。`upsertMessage` で過去メッセージを更新した場合は `lastSavedLogLength` 未満のインデックスが変更されるため保存されません。更新も検知するなら:

1. `chatLog` のハッシュを取り、差分を検出する。
2. メッセージごとに `updatedAt` を持ち、比較する。
3. あるいは `upsertMessage` で「更新フラグ」を別バッファに積む。

などの方式が必要です。現状では音声 API が途中で内容を更新するシナリオで永続化漏れが起こります。

_⚠️ Potential issue_

**`upsertMessage` の更新ロジックが既存 `content` を上書きする恐れ**

`{ ...existingMessage, ...message }` でマージすると、`message` に `content: ''` が含まれる場合に既存の本文が空文字で上書きされます。更新時にプロパティが `undefined`・空文字かを判定して、意図しない消去を防ぐことを推奨します。

```diff
- updatedChatLog[existingMessageIndex] = {
-   ...existingMessage,
-   ...message,
-   id: messageId,
- }
+ updatedChatLog[existingMessageIndex] = {
+   ...existingMessage,
+   ...Object.fromEntries(
+     Object.entries(message).filter(
+       ([, v]) => v !== undefined && (v !== '' || typeof v === 'object')
+     )
+   ),
+   id: messageId,
+ }
```

これにより `audio` だけを更新したいケースでも本文が消えないようになります。

**ID が `undefined` のメッセージまでもマージされてしまう可能性があります**

`lastItem.id === item.id` は、どちらも `undefined` の場合でも `true` になります。  
「ID が明示的に一致する場合のみマージしたい」という意図であれば、下記のように **両方の ID が存在していること** を条件に追加してください。

```diff
-      lastItem.role === item.role &&
-      lastItem.id === item.id
+      lastItem.role === item.role &&
+      lastItem.id !== undefined &&
+      item.id !== undefined &&
+      lastItem.id === item.id
```

ID 未設定のメッセージを誤って連結すると、異なるチャット発話が結合されて内容が壊れる恐れがあります。

**mockChatLog の共有状態に注意 & upsertMessage の実装差異を考慮してください**

- `mockChatLog` は `beforeEach` 内で初期化されているためテスト間でリークしませんが、`upsertMessage` が `content` プロパティを付与しないまま push するケースがあります（`newMessage.content` が `undefined` の場合）。
- 本番実装では `content: ''` を明示的に付けているかもしれませんが、このモックは付けていないため、後続アサーションと齟齬が生じる可能性があります。  
  パイプライン失敗の原因となっているので、モックかアサーションのどちらかを揃えましょう。

@tegnike 以下の修正計画を提案します：

1. **問題点**: テストが失敗している原因は、モックの `upsertMessage` 実装が新しいメッセージを追加する際に `content` プロパティのデフォルト値を設定していないためです。一方、テストの期待値は `content: ''` を含んでいます。

2. **修正案**: スクリプト実行の結果から、以下の修正を行うことで問題が解決できます:
```diff
- mockChatLog.push(newMessage)
+ mockChatLog.push({ content: '', ...newMessage })
```

3. **実装計画**: 
   - この修正により、新しいメッセージが追加される際に常に `content: ''` を持つことが保証されます
   - 実際の `upsertMessage` 実装に近い動作になります
   - テストの期待値 `{ role: 'assistant', audio: { id: 'audio-id-123' }, content: '', id: 'audio-id-123' }` と一致するようになります

この修正を進めてよろしいでしょうか？

- Buffers incoming `ArrayBuffer` data until a threshold is reached, then sends via a callback.
- `addData` merges new data into the buffer.
- `flush` forces sending any remaining buffered data.
- Used in the test to mock audio data buffering and sending.

```
- Factory function returning an async handler for receiving text or audio buffers.
- Handles different modes (`realtimeAPIMode`, `audioMode`) from settings.
- If role is `assistant` and type indicates audio response, calls `speakCharacter` with audio buffer.
- If type indicates content part done, updates chat messages.
- Used in the test as a mocked function to verify text/audio handling.

- Main function under test.
- Calls OpenAI chat completions API with audio and text streaming enabled.
- Uses `messageSelectors.getAudioMessages` to filter messages.
- Returns a `ReadableStream` that processes streamed chunks:
  - Enqueues transcript text to the stream controller.
  - Buffers audio data using `AudioBufferManager`.
  - Updates chat log with audio message IDs.
- Handles errors by logging and rethrowing.
- The test mocks and verifies this behavior extensively.

---

#### File: `src/features/messages/messageSelectors.ts` (lines 4-178)
- Contains multiple message filtering and processing functions.
- Relevant function used in `getOpenAIAudioChatResponseStream`:

```ts
getAudioMessages: (messages: Message[]): Message[] => {
  return messages.filter((message) => {
    if (message.role === 'system') {
      return message.content
    }
    if (message.role === 'user') {
      return typeof message.content === 'string'
    }
    if (message.role === 'assistant') {
      return message.audio !== undefined
    }
    return false
  })
}
```
- Filters messages to those relevant for audio chat:
  - System messages with content.
  - User messages with string content.
  - Assistant messages that have an `audio` property.
- Used in the tested function to prepare messages for the OpenAI API call.

**Consistent naming convention for template assets**

Renaming from ""QR-lines""/""QR-title"" to ""qr-lines""/""qr-title"" improves naming consistency. Ensure that all references to these assets throughout the codebase have been updated accordingly.

**Action Required: Update Remaining Uppercase Reference to Template Asset**

While the JSON file in `playground/public/template-assets/index.json` has been correctly updated to use `""qr-lines""` and `""qr-title""`, we found an outstanding reference in another file. In `playground/scripts/generate-templates-list-json.js`, the `featuredTemplates` array still contains `""QR-lines""`. For naming consistency across the codebase, please update this entry from `""QR-lines""` to `""qr-lines""`.

- **Location:** `playground/scripts/generate-templates-list-json.js`
- **Change:** Replace `""QR-lines""` with `""qr-lines""` in the `featuredTemplates` array.

**Enhance error handling and performance in BeginBlocker.**

The current implementation iterates through all cron jobs on every block and has minimal error details in logs. Consider these improvements:


```diff
 func BeginBlocker(ctx sdk.Context, k keeper.Keeper) {
 	crons := k.GetCronJobs(ctx)
+	if len(crons) == 0 {
+		return
+	}
+	
+	logger := ctx.Logger().With(""module"", ""cron"")
+	
 	for _, cron := range crons {
 		if cron.EnableCron {
 			for _, job := range cron.MsgContractCron {
 				err := k.SudoContractCall(ctx, job.ContractAddress, []byte(job.JsonMsg))
 				if err != nil {
-					ctx.Logger().Error(""Cronjob failed for: "", cron.Name, "" contract: "", job.ContractAddress)
+					logger.Error(
+						""Cronjob execution failed"",
+						""name"", cron.Name,
+						""id"", cron.Id,
+						""contract"", job.ContractAddress,
+						""error"", err.Error(),
+					)
 				} else {
-					ctx.Logger().Info(""Cronjob success for: "", cron.Name, "" contract: "", job.ContractAddress)
+					logger.Info(
+						""Cronjob executed successfully"",
+						""name"", cron.Name,
+						""id"", cron.Id,
+						""contract"", job.ContractAddress,
+					)
 				}
 			}
 		}
 	}
 }
```

This implementation:
1. Adds an early return for empty cron jobs to avoid unnecessary processing
2. Uses structured logging with key-value pairs for better log parsing
3. Includes more detailed error information and cron job ID for better debugging
4. Adds module context to logs

🏁 Script executed:

```shell
#!/bin/bash

```

</details>

**Action: Update BeginBlocker to use early exits and structured logging for enhanced error tracking.**

The current implementation in *x/cron/abci.go* can be improved to:
- Return early when there are no cron jobs, avoiding unnecessary iterations.
- Leverage structured logging (as seen in other modules like x/ibc-hooks, x/epochs, etc.) by creating a dedicated logger instance with module context.
- Log detailed error information—including the cron job ID and error message—for better traceability in debug logs.

Consider the following refactored diff:

```diff
 func BeginBlocker(ctx sdk.Context, k keeper.Keeper) {
-	crons := k.GetCronJobs(ctx)
+	crons := k.GetCronJobs(ctx)
+	if len(crons) == 0 {
+		return
+	}
+	
+	logger := ctx.Logger().With(""module"", ""cron"")
 	
 	for _, cron := range crons {
 		if cron.EnableCron {
 			for _, job := range cron.MsgContractCron {
 				err := k.SudoContractCall(ctx, job.ContractAddress, []byte(job.JsonMsg))
 				if err != nil {
-					ctx.Logger().Error(""Cronjob failed for: "", cron.Name, "" contract: "", job.ContractAddress)
+					logger.Error(
+						""Cronjob execution failed"",
+						""name"", cron.Name,
+						""id"", cron.Id,
+						""contract"", job.ContractAddress,
+						""error"", err.Error(),
+					)
 				} else {
-					ctx.Logger().Info(""Cronjob success for: "", cron.Name, "" contract: "", job.ContractAddress)
+					logger.Info(
+						""Cronjob executed successfully"",
+						""name"", cron.Name,
+						""id"", cron.Id,
+						""contract"", job.ContractAddress,
+					)
 				}
 			}
 		}
 	}
 }
```

This update not only improves performance by avoiding unnecessary work when there are no cron jobs but also aligns the logging style with our existing patterns for better consistency and debugging.

**Add parameter validation before setting.**

While the implementation correctly uses the paramstore, it doesn't validate the parameters before setting them. For security-critical parameters like `security_address`, validation is essential.

```diff
 // SetParams sets the x/cron module parameters.
 func (k Keeper) SetParams(ctx sdk.Context, p types.Params) {
+  // Validate parameters before setting
+  if err := p.Validate(); err != nil {
+    panic(err)
+  }
   k.paramstore.SetParamSet(ctx, &p)
 }
```

This assumes you have a `Validate()` method implemented on the `Params` type, which you should add to ensure parameter integrity (e.g., checking that security addresses are valid and not empty).

**Potential issue with CronID assignment logic.**

The current implementation sets the CronID to the ID of the last cronJob processed. This assumes that IDs in the genesis state are ordered and that the highest ID will be the last one. However, if the jobs aren't ordered by ID in the CronJobs slice, this could lead to ID conflicts or gaps.

Consider finding the maximum ID instead:


```diff
func (k Keeper) InitGenesis(ctx sdk.Context, genState types.GenesisState) {
    if err := genState.Validate(); err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    var (
-       cronID uint64
+       maxCronID uint64
    )
    for _, item := range genState.CronJobs {
        k.SetCronJob(ctx, item)
        // Find the max cron ID
-       cronID = item.Id
+       if item.Id > maxCronID {
+           maxCronID = item.Id
+       }
    }
-   k.SetCronID(ctx, cronID)

    k.SetParams(ctx, genState.Params)
}

**Avoid panic in GetSigners method.**

The `GetSigners` method currently panics if the security address is invalid. This can lead to unexpected crashes when the message is processed. It would be better to validate the address during `ValidateBasic()` rather than risking a panic.

```diff
func (msg *MsgRegisterCron) GetSigners() []sdk.AccAddress {
	creator, err := sdk.AccAddressFromBech32(msg.SecurityAddress)
	if err != nil {
-		panic(err)
+		// This should never happen as ValidateBasic should catch invalid addresses
+		// Return empty address array instead of panicking
+		return []sdk.AccAddress{}
	}
	return []sdk.AccAddress{creator}
}
```

Note: The `ValidateBasic` method already checks for address validity, so this situation should never occur if `ValidateBasic` is called before `GetSigners`. However, defensive programming is still advisable.

**Consider adding rate limiting or cost control measures.**

The OpenAI API has usage costs based on tokens. For production use, you should consider implementing rate limiting or budget controls to prevent unexpected costs.



Consider:
1. Implementing a token budget per user
2. Adding rate limiting for requests
3. Monitoring API usage and costs

---

🏁 Script executed:

```shell
#!/bin/bash
# Check if the project has any rate limiting implementation for OpenAI API calls

# Look for rate limiting related code
echo ""Searching for rate limiting implementations:""
rg -i ""ratelimit|throttle|cooldown"" --type ts

# Check if we use any Redis-based rate limiting (common approach)
echo ""Checking for Redis-based rate limiting:""
rg ""@upstash/ratelimit"" --type ts -A 10
```

Length of output: 3588

---



</details>

**Action Required: Integrate Cost Control Measures for OpenAI API Calls**

While the codebase already incorporates rate limiting in other modules (for example, in `apps/mail/lib/rateLimit.ts` and within the early-access route), the OpenAI API call in `apps/mail/actions/ai.ts` does not use any rate limiting or cost control measures. To prevent unexpected API costs in production, please consider adding similar controls here.

Recommendations:
- Reuse or adapt the existing rate limiter (e.g., the `waitlistRateLimiter` from `apps/mail/lib/rateLimit.ts`).
- Implement a token budget per user to control request costs.
- Add monitoring to track API usage and alert on abnormal consumption.

```suggestion
            const errorMessage = error.name === 'NotAllowedError' ? 'Unable to authenticate with passkey. See developer console for more details.' : error.message;
```"
2621533077,2169555247,halter73,,,Can we add a regression test verifying that we do submit the form given an AbortError an non-conditional  mediation?
2621533077,2169728068,MackinnonBuck,,,"Yeah, maybe we could improve the wording here. The thing about ""Unable to authenticate with passkey"" is that IMO it could be interpreted as if passkey was obtained, but we just couldn't authenticate with it (implying a possible error on the server). Whereas, what actually happened is that the authenticator couldn't authenticate the user, so no passkey was provided to the browser. Maybe something like ""No passkey was provided by the authenticator"" could work?

And regarding ""See developer console for more details"" - this is definitely helpful to the developer, but might it be unusual to display this to the user? The fact that this error shows up in a user-facing part of the UI makes me a little hesitant to put that there. I guess the developer could always remove that bit if they want."
2621533077,2169742653,MackinnonBuck,,,"Maybe... there's no way using CDP to cause the call to `navigator.credentials.create()` or `navigator.credentials.get()` to return a rejected promise AFAICT: https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/tot/WebAuthn/. The protocol only lets you make the promise fail to resolve (which is different from rejecting) or resolve to a bad credential which causes the server-side verification to fail and that's different from what we'd be trying to test here.

We might be able to simulate this in Playwright by injecting some JavaScript that overrides those functions to return a rejected promise with the error we're expecting to catch here. Let me try that."

2299225316,1930167312,davidfowl,,,"Do you want the delay to catch missed updates? SetLatestEvent and DelayAsync aren't synchronized. That means a call to SetLatestEvent  then Delay async won't yield.

I would suggest using a channel (instead of a tcs) if you don't want to miss updates. It would also remove allocations."
2299225316,1930183757,JamesNK,,,"Missing updates seems fine. There isn't a 1:1 relationship between the state of a resource and its health result, so timing between events will never be precisie. Everything is eventually consistent."
2299225316,1930223171,JamesNK,,,"I changed my mind. Previously a missed update when healthy would be caught by the polling in a second. Now there is always a 30 second wait until interrupted.

I added some locking and improved the interrupt decision to consider the resource version and state. I'm not 100% sure why a change in the snapshot should cause health checks to rerun, no tests cover that situation, but I think state change (such as `Running` to another state) is what it makes sense to consider."
2299225316,1930260528,davidfowl,,,This class needs more comments.
2299225316,1931075339,eerhardt,,,"This code isn't multi-threaded, right? There is just 1 thread/loop processing these events. So is there a need to lock here?"
2299225316,1931079964,eerhardt,,,I guess there is an internal `GetResourceMonitorState` that is used for tests that could be on a different thread.
2299225316,1931478459,JamesNK,,,"Yes. I didn't want tests to fail because the dictionary was in a bad state during a get.

The lock will never be contended in the real world, and this isn't performance critical code, so it seemed better to add some safety in the cause of test stability."

2529171096,2096572080,weshaggard,,,OK I think this log message might cause confusion and we should either remove it and leave it up to spec-gen-sdk tool to log and in the runner we just pass whichever parameters we have.

The group log is written by runner, and runner passes spec configs to spec-gen-sdk tool. Then spec-gen-sdk tool validate spec configs and determine the right configuration to be used for code generation. Currently users are able to know the details when expanding the logs.
What do you suggest for the group log title?"

2529171096,2099085613,weshaggard,,,Probably worth adding a comment as to why this is removed.
2529171096,2100931990,raych1,,,"The issue here is 'awsconnector' service folder contains a bunch of sub services and all of them don't enable SDK emitters in their 'tspconfig.yaml'. This causes every sub service to generate code based on parent readme.md.
With further thoughts, I plan to add an option to 'spec-gen-sdk' tool to skip SDK generation for TypeSpecs batch runs if the paired 'readme.md' has the SDK configuration but 'tspconfig.yaml' don't have the SDK configuration."

**Improve error handling in `loadPageBySlug`.**

**Consider adding pagination handling for large databases.**

The `loadDatabase` action effectively fetches and normalizes database pages, but it doesn't appear to handle pagination for large Notion databases. If the database grows significantly, you might need to fetch multiple pages of results.

---

```shell
#!/bin/bash
# Check if the Notion API response has pagination
rg -A 5 ""next_cursor|has_more"" --glob ""*.js"" --glob ""*.vue""

Let’s locate where `fetchNotionDatabasePages` is defined to see if it already handles pagination:

**Add pagination support to `loadDatabase`**

The current `loadDatabase` implementation only fetches the first page of results and never checks Notion’s `has_more`/`next_cursor` fields. For large databases you’ll need to iterate through all pages:

– File: `client/stores/notion_cms.js`, around the `loadDatabase` action  
– Issue: `fetchNotionDatabasePages` simply calls the worker once, without passing `start_cursor` or looping  
– Suggested approach:  
  1. Extend `notionApiFetch` (or `fetchNotionDatabasePages`) to accept an optional `start_cursor` parameter.  
  2. In `loadDatabase`, use an async loop (e.g. `do … while (has_more)`) to:  
     • Call the API with the current cursor  
     • Accumulate `response.data.results` (or `.value`) into a local array  
     • Update `has_more` and `next_cursor`  
  3. Once complete, normalize and store all pages as before.

Example sketch:
```js
async function loadDatabase(databaseId) {
  const allPages = []
  let cursor = undefined
  let hasMore = false

  do {
    const { data } = await fetchNotionDatabasePages(databaseId, cursor)
    allPages.push(...data.value)
    hasMore = data.has_more
    cursor = data.next_cursor
  } while (hasMore)

  // normalize allPages into databases.value and pages.value…
}
```

This ensures you’ll retrieve every page of a growing Notion database rather than only the first batch.

**Consider browser compatibility for `replaceAll`.**

The `replaceAll` method was introduced in ES2021 and might not be supported in all browsers your application targets. Consider using a more widely supported alternative or ensuring you have appropriate polyfills.

---

🌐 Web query:

```web
When was replaceAll added to JavaScript and what browsers support it?
```

💡 Result:

The `replaceAll()` method was introduced in JavaScript as part of the ECMAScript 2021 (ES12) specification. This method allows for replacing all occurrences of a specified substring or pattern within a string. ([developer.mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replaceAll?utm_source=openai))

Browser support for `replaceAll()` varies:

- **Chrome**: Supported since version 85, released on August 25, 2020. ([web-platform-dx.github.io](https://web-platform-dx.github.io/web-features-explorer/features/string-replaceall/?utm_source=openai))

- **Firefox**: Supported since version 77, released on June 2, 2020. ([web-platform-dx.github.io](https://web-platform-dx.github.io/web-features-explorer/features/string-replaceall/?utm_source=openai))

- **Safari**: Supported since version 13.1, released on March 24, 2020. ([web-platform-dx.github.io](https://web-platform-dx.github.io/web-features-explorer/features/string-replaceall/?utm_source=openai))

- **Edge**: Supported since version 85, released on August 27, 2020. ([web-platform-dx.github.io](https://web-platform-dx.github.io/web-features-explorer/features/string-replaceall/?utm_source=openai))

- **Opera**: Supported since version 71, released on September 15, 2020. ([web-platform-dx.github.io](https://web-platform-dx.github.io/web-features-explorer/features/string-replaceall/?utm_source=openai))

It's important to note that `replaceAll()` is not supported in Internet Explorer. ([caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com/mdn-javascript_builtins_string_replaceall?utm_source=openai))

For environments where `replaceAll()` is not available, developers can use alternative methods such as `replace()` with a global regular expression or a combination of `split()` and `join()`. ([developer.mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replaceAll?utm_source=openai))

**Ensure compatibility for String.replaceAll**

The `String.prototype.replaceAll` method is ES2021 and isn’t supported in older browsers (notably Internet Explorer). Since we don’t have a Browserslist or Babel/polyfill setup in `client/`, please choose one of the following:

• Replace `replaceAll` with a global-regex or `split`/`join` fallback  
• Add a polyfill (e.g. `core-js`) or configure Babel’s `@babel/preset-env` with an appropriate Browserslist

 const page = notionCmsStore.getPage(pageId)

**Delegate `mapImageUrl` to Vue-Notion’s default implementation**

The stub in `client/components/pages/notion/useNotionBlock.js` should at least mirror the default behavior provided by `vue-notion`. Import and invoke `defaultMapImageUrl` so you get consistent URL handling. If you need custom logic later, extend from there.

• File: `client/components/pages/notion/useNotionBlock.js`  
  Lines: ~84–87

Suggested change:
```diff
+ import { defaultMapImageUrl } from 'vue-notion'

  function mapImageUrl(source) {
-   // Implement your mapImageUrl logic here
-   return source
+   return defaultMapImageUrl(source)
  }

**Consider security risks with v-html**

Using v-html can expose the application to XSS attacks if the content is not properly sanitized.


Either ensure that the steps content is properly sanitized before rendering, or consider alternatives:

```diff
-                <span v-html=""step"" />
+                <span>{{ step }}</span>
```

If HTML formatting is required, consider using a safe HTML sanitizer like DOMPurify:

```javascript
import DOMPurify from 'dompurify'

// Then in your component
const sanitizeHtml = (html) => DOMPurify.sanitize(html)

// In template
<span v-html=""sanitizeHtml(step)""></span>

**Replace placeholder text**

""This can be another text"" appears to be placeholder text that should be replaced with final content.

---

🌐 Web query:

```web
What is the standard text for integration guide section headers?
```

💡 Result:

In technical documentation, particularly integration guides, it's essential to use clear, descriptive headings to organize content effectively. These headings should accurately reflect the content of each section, enabling readers to navigate the document with ease. Avoid generic or functional headings like ""Introduction"" or ""Conclusion,"" as they don't provide specific information about the section's content. ([pressbooks.senecapolytechnic.ca](https://pressbooks.senecapolytechnic.ca/technicalwriting/chapter/headings/?utm_source=openai))

A well-structured integration guide typically includes the following sections, each with a descriptive heading:

1. **Introduction**: Provides an overview of the integration process, its purpose, and the intended audience.

2. **System Requirements**: Details the hardware, software, and network prerequisites for a successful integration.

3. **Installation and Setup**: Offers step-by-step instructions for installing and configuring the system components.

4. **Configuration**: Guides users through the necessary configurations to tailor the system to their specific needs.

5. **Usage Examples**: Demonstrates common use cases and workflows to help users understand practical applications.

6. **Troubleshooting**: Addresses potential issues and provides solutions to common problems encountered during integration.

7. **Best Practices**: Recommends strategies for optimizing performance, security, and maintainability.

8. **Glossary**: Defines technical terms and acronyms used throughout the guide to ensure clarity.

By employing specific and descriptive headings, you enhance the document's usability, allowing readers to quickly locate the information they need. This approach also improves the document's accessibility, as users can scan headings to find relevant sections efficiently.

**Move `resolveComponent` out of the prop default**

Using `resolveComponent` in a prop’s default factory runs before the render context is fully set up and can lead to “no active instance” errors. All other dynamic components in this codebase (e.g. in IntegrationModal.vue, ProviderWidgetModal.vue) resolve their components inside a `computed`, which is the correct pattern.

Please update `NotionPage.vue` as follows:

• In the `props` block, change `pageLinkOptions` to use a plain default:  
```diff
- pageLinkOptions: {
-   type: Object,
-   default: () => {
-     const NuxtLink = resolveComponent('NuxtLink')
-     return { component: NuxtLink, href: 'to' }
-   }
- },
+ pageLinkOptions: {
+   type: Object,
+   default: () => ({})
+ },
```

• Add a computed property that resolves the link component at render time:  
```js
export default {
  // …
  props: { /* as above */ },
  computed: {
    resolvedPageLinkOptions() {
      const NuxtLink = resolveComponent('NuxtLink')
      return { component: NuxtLink, href: 'to', ...this.pageLinkOptions }
    },
    // existing computed…
  }
}
```

• In the template, bind to the new computed:  
```diff
- :page-link-options=""pageLinkOptions""
+ :page-link-options=""resolvedPageLinkOptions""
```

This ensures `resolveComponent` runs with an active instance and matches the pattern used elsewhere.

In frontend/app/equity/dividends/page.tsx around lines 155 to 159, the current
chained replaceAll calls for replacing placeholders in the release_document
string are unsafe and may cause incorrect replacements if placeholders appear in
the content or if user.legalName contains special characters. Refactor this by
implementing a safer template replacement method, such as using a function that
replaces placeholders via a regex with proper escaping or by using a lightweight
template engine to handle the substitutions securely and correctly.

**Address potential floating-point precision issues in currency calculation.**

The current code divides by 100.0 which may introduce floating-point precision errors for currency amounts.


Since `total_amount_in_cents` is already in cents, pass it directly to `number_to_currency` with the appropriate unit option:

```diff
-      html = dividend.dividend_round.release_document.gsub(""{{investor}}"", Current.user.legal_name).gsub(""{{amount}}"", number_to_currency(dividend.total_amount_in_cents / 100.0))
+      html = dividend.dividend_round.release_document.gsub(""{{investor}}"", Current.user.legal_name).gsub(""{{amount}}"", number_to_currency(dividend.total_amount_in_cents, unit: ""$"", precision: 2, format: ""%u%n""))
```

Alternatively, if the method expects dollars:

```diff
-      html = dividend.dividend_round.release_document.gsub(""{{investor}}"", Current.user.legal_name).gsub(""{{amount}}"", number_to_currency(dividend.total_amount_in_cents / 100.0))
+      html = dividend.dividend_round.release_document.gsub(""{{investor}}"", Current.user.legal_name).gsub(""{{amount}}"", number_to_currency(dividend.total_amount_in_cents.to_f / 100))
```

In backend/app/controllers/internal/companies/dividends_controller.rb at line
19, avoid dividing total_amount_in_cents by 100.0 to prevent floating-point
precision errors. Instead, pass total_amount_in_cents directly to
number_to_currency and specify the unit as cents or use the method's options to
correctly format the amount as dollars without manual division. Adjust the call
to number_to_currency accordingly to handle the currency conversion internally.

**Fix potential race condition and improve error handling.**

The test has several issues that could make it flaky:

1. **Race condition**: The `ListenerAddrFunc` callback may execute asynchronously, but the test immediately checks the results without ensuring the callback has completed.

2. **Error variable overwriting**: The `err` variable from `os.Stat` in the callback overwrites the original `err` from `app.Listen`, which could mask listening errors.

3. **Incomplete cleanup**: There's no guarantee the Unix socket file is properly closed before cleanup.



Apply this diff to fix the issues:

```diff
 	go func() {
 		time.Sleep(1000 * time.Millisecond)
 		assert.NoError(t, app.Shutdown())
 	}()
 
 	tmp, err := os.MkdirTemp(os.TempDir(), ""fiber-test"")

```
In listen_test.go around lines 450 to 475, fix the race condition by
synchronizing the ListenerAddrFunc callback execution before assertions, for
example using a channel or wait group to wait for the callback to complete.
Avoid overwriting the original err from app.Listen by using a separate variable
inside the callback for os.Stat error. Ensure proper cleanup by closing the
listener or socket before removing the temporary directory to prevent resource
conflicts during cleanup.

The E2E test for cardinality was updated to expect `zeroOrOneLeft` (1:1 relationship) instead of `zeroOrManyLeft` (1:n relationship) for the `account_aliases` table.

### Why this change was needed:

The test was previously expecting a ONE_TO_MANY relationship, but this was incorrect. The `account_aliases` table has a UNIQUE constraint on the `account_id` column, which makes it a ONE_TO_ONE relationship with the `accounts` table.

### Root cause:

The schemarb parser had a bug where it would correctly parse UNIQUE constraints into the constraints collection, but the `handleOneToOneRelationships` function only checked the column's `unique` property, not the constraints collection. This caused relationships defined via unique indexes (common in Rails schemas) to be incorrectly identified as ONE_TO_MANY.

Our new `constraintsToRelationships` function correctly checks both:
- The column's `unique` property
- UNIQUE constraints in the constraints collection

This ensures accurate cardinality detection regardless of how the uniqueness was defined in the schema.

### What changed:
- Test now expects `url(#zeroOrOneLeft)` instead of `url(#zeroOrManyLeft)`
- Also updated the edge selector from test-id to an accessible role selector for better test maintainability

### Note on parser fix:
While this is technically a bug in the schemarb parser, we don't need to fix it because the `relationships` field will be removed entirely in Phase 2 of this deprecation. The `constraintsToRelationships` function provides the correct behavior going forward.

### Adding changeset for relationship cardinality fix ✅

**Todo List:**
- [x] Read CONTRIBUTING.md to understand changeset format
- [x] Extract key information from the review comment
- [x] Create changeset file with appropriate packages and description
- [x] Commit the changeset file

**Completed successfully!**

I've created and committed a changeset that addresses the ONE_TO_ONE relationship cardinality fix mentioned in the review comment. The changeset includes:

**Affected packages:**
- `@liam-hq/db-structure`: patch (main changes to constraintsToRelationships utility)
- `@liam-hq/erd-core`: patch (updated to use new utility)
- `@liam-hq/e2e`: patch (test updates for correct cardinality expectations)

**What the changeset covers:**
- Fixes the bug where ONE_TO_ONE relationships were incorrectly displayed as ONE_TO_MANY when using UNIQUE constraints
- Explains the root cause: relationship detection only checked column `unique` property, not table UNIQUE constraints
- Documents the solution: `constraintsToRelationships` now checks both column properties and constraint collections
- Notes the E2E test updates to expect correct cardinality values

The changeset has been committed as: `8f9f70cd88b528bd6dfc5ef49682cfb2283b1eda`

**Switch renders nicely, but give it some air**

The switch appears directly under the search row. A small vertical margin keeps the UI from feeling cramped and avoids accidental taps.

```diff
-        {isHiddenWallet && editMode ? (
-          <HiddenWalletRememberSwitch wallet={focusedWalletInfo?.wallet} />
+        {isHiddenWallet && editMode ? (

         ) : null}
```

**Improved cookie retrieval with HttpUrl.**

Converting the endpoint string to HttpUrl before retrieving cookies is more robust than using raw strings, as it ensures proper URL parsing and host extraction.


However, there's no error handling if the endpoint URL is malformed. Consider adding a try-catch block:

```diff
-                    CookieStore.getCookie(endpoint.toHttpUrl(), CookieStore.AFFINE_SESSION)?.let {
+                    try {
+                        CookieStore.getCookie(endpoint.toHttpUrl(), CookieStore.AFFINE_SESSION)?.let {
+                            Timber.i(""$method sign in success."")
+                            Timber.d(""Update session [$it]"")
+                            call.resolve(JSObject().put(""token"", it))

+                            Timber.w(""$method sign in fail, token not found."")
+                            call.reject(""$method sign in fail, token not found"")
+                        }

**Consider adding safeguards for uninitialized properties.**

The service correctly implements a singleton pattern with state management for workspace and document context. However, the use of `lateinit` properties without initialization checks could lead to `UninitializedPropertyAccessException` if the accessor methods are called before `update()`.



Consider adding initialization checks:

```diff
-    fun workspaceId() = _workspaceId
+    fun workspaceId(): String {
+        if (!::_workspaceId.isInitialized) {
+            return """"  // Or throw a more descriptive exception
+        }
+        return _workspaceId
+    }

// Similar changes for docId() and docContentInMD()
```

Alternatively, consider using nullable types with initial null values instead of lateinit:

```diff
-    private lateinit var _workspaceId: String
+    private var _workspaceId: String? = null

-    fun workspaceId() = _workspaceId
+    fun workspaceId() = _workspaceId ?: """"  // Provide a default or throw a descriptive exception
```

**Handle uninitialized server URL.**

The service now maintains a dynamic server URL, but if `messageStream` is called before `updateServer`, it will throw an `UninitializedPropertyAccessException`. Consider adding initialization checks or providing fallback values.



```diff
-    private lateinit var _server: String
+    private var _server: String? = null

     fun messageStream(sessionId: String, messageId: String) =
-        ""$_server/api/copilot/chat/$sessionId/stream?messageId=$messageId"".eventSource()
+        ""${_server ?: throw IllegalStateException(""Server URL not initialized"")}/api/copilot/chat/$sessionId/stream?messageId=$messageId"".eventSource()
```

This change will provide a more descriptive error if the service is used incorrectly.

**Consider displaying Git errors or omitting metrics if `gitMetrics.error` is present.**  
If the metrics calculation failed, you may want to render this in the XML to inform users of the issue. Alternatively, you could skip the entire `<git_metrics>` block when `gitMetrics.error` is truthy.

Additionally, you should update the implementation to handle invalid commit counts:

**Critical issue: Zoom provider missing from supportedProviders.**

The type assertion resolves TypeScript compilation, but `supportedProviders` only includes Google and Microsoft providers. If a Zoom account reaches this function, it will throw ""Provider not supported"" error on line 25, despite Zoom being added as a valid provider elsewhere in the system.



Either add Zoom to `supportedProviders` or ensure Zoom accounts are filtered out before reaching this function:

**Cancellation must occur _before_ the available-shares check**

`insufficient_available_shares?` is evaluated _before_ the current grant
is cancelled.  
If the pool is tight, the early `return` prevents reclaiming unvested
shares and makes legitimate renewals impossible.

Refactor to cancel first, then reevaluate availability:

```diff
- return build_result(...) if insufficient_available_shares?
-
 ...
- current_grant = company_investor.equity_grants.where(...).first
- CancelEquityGrant.new(...).process if current_grant.present?
+ current_grant = company_investor.equity_grants.where(...).first
+ CancelEquityGrant.new(equity_grant: current_grant,
+                       reason: VestingEvent::CANCELLATION_REASONS[:new_grant_created]).process if current_grant
+
+ return build_result(...) if insufficient_available_shares?
```

This keeps the invariant “available = pool.total – issued” accurate
before the size check.

**Validate `reason` against an explicit enum instead of free-form string**  

Accepting an arbitrary string opens the door to typos that will silently break downstream analytics / reporting and may violate DB CHECK constraints if they exist on `vesting_events.cancellation_reason`.  
Define a shared enum (or import the one from the backend model) and let Zod enforce it.

```diff

string. This ensures only allowed values are accepted and prevents silent errors

**Race-condition & consistency concerns inside the cancellation transaction**  

1. `totalForfeitedShares` is computed **before** the transaction and could be
   stale if another vesting event processes between the `SELECT` and the `BEGIN`.
2. `issuedShares` update subtracts the pre-transaction `unvestedShares`; the
   same concurrent scenario can yield a negative balance.
3. Multiple `new Date()` calls will write slightly different timestamps.

Suggested approach (simplified):

```diff
 await db.transaction(async (tx) => {
+  const now = new Date();

-  await tx.insert(equityGrantTransactions).values([
+  // Re-read the row FOR UPDATE to lock it and get fresh numbers
+  const [lockedGrant] = await tx
+    .select()
+    .from(equityGrants)
+    .where(eq(equityGrants.id, equityGrant.id))
+    .forUpdate();
+
+  const forfeited = lockedGrant.unvestedShares;
+
+  await tx.insert(equityGrantTransactions).values([
     {
       transactionType: ""cancellation"",
-      equityGrantId: equityGrant.id,
-      forfeitedShares: BigInt(equityGrant.unvestedShares),
-      totalNumberOfShares: BigInt(equityGrant.numberOfShares),
-      totalVestedShares: BigInt(equityGrant.vestedShares),
+      equityGrantId: lockedGrant.id,
+      forfeitedShares: BigInt(forfeited),
+      totalNumberOfShares: BigInt(lockedGrant.numberOfShares),
+      totalVestedShares: BigInt(lockedGrant.vestedShares),
       totalUnvestedShares: 0n,
-      totalExercisedShares: BigInt(equityGrant.exercisedShares),
-      totalForfeitedShares: BigInt(totalForfeitedShares),
+      totalExercisedShares: BigInt(lockedGrant.exercisedShares),
+      totalForfeitedShares: BigInt(lockedGrant.forfeitedShares + forfeited),
     },
   ]);

-  for (const vestingEvent of equityGrant.vestingEvents) {
+  for (const vestingEvent of lockedGrant.vestingEvents) {
     await tx
       .update(vestingEvents)
-      .set({ cancelledAt: new Date(), cancellationReason: input.reason })
+      .set({ cancelledAt: now, cancellationReason: input.reason })
       .where(eq(vestingEvents.id, vestingEvent.id));
   }

   await tx
     .update(equityGrants)
     .set({
-      forfeitedShares: totalForfeitedShares,
+      forfeitedShares: lockedGrant.forfeitedShares + forfeited,
       unvestedShares: 0,
-      cancelledAt: new Date(),
+      cancelledAt: now,
     })
     .where(eq(equityGrants.id, lockedGrant.id));

   await tx
     .update(optionPools)
-    .set({ issuedShares: equityGrant.optionPool.issuedShares - BigInt(equityGrant.unvestedShares) })
+    .set({ issuedShares: lockedGrant.optionPool.issuedShares - BigInt(forfeited) })
     .where(eq(optionPools.id, lockedGrant.optionPoolId));
 });
```

This locks the grant row, eliminates micro-time drift, and guarantees
mathematical correctness even under high concurrency.

In frontend/trpc/routes/equityGrants.ts lines 388 to 427, the transaction uses
pre-transaction values for totalForfeitedShares and unvestedShares, risking
stale data and race conditions. To fix this, move the calculation of
totalForfeitedShares inside the transaction after locking the equityGrant row
for update, use a single timestamp variable for all date fields to avoid
micro-time drift, and recalculate issuedShares based on the locked data to
ensure consistency and prevent negative balances under concurrency.

In frontend/app/invoices/index.tsx around lines 276 to 281, the Label component
uses an htmlFor attribute pointing to ""delete-warning"" but there is no matching
input element with that id. To fix this, either remove the htmlFor attribute
from the Label component or replace the Label with a paragraph (<p>) element to
correctly represent the text without associating it with a form input.

[error] 408-408: Avoid the use of spread (`...`) syntax on accumulators.

Spread syntax should be avoided on accumulators (like those in `.reduce`) because it causes a time complexity of `O(n^2)`.
Consider methods such as .splice or .push instead.

```
In frontend/app/invoices/page.tsx at line 408, the use of spread syntax inside
the reduce accumulator causes O(n²) time complexity. To fix this, replace the
spread syntax with direct mutation of the accumulator object by initializing it
as an empty object and adding each id as a key with value true inside the reduce
callback, then return the accumulator without spreading it.

**Flagged rich text editor component for Next.js 15 compatibility**

The added comment flags the `RichTextEditorField` component as needing attention during the React 19/Next.js 15 upgrade, which is consistent with similar markings in other files. This is a good practice to highlight components that may need fixes.



Consider investigating the specific compatibility issues with rich text editors in Next.js 15. A typical approach would be to:

1. Check for breaking changes in the Next.js 15 documentation
2. Verify if any third-party rich text editor dependencies need updates
3. Test the component thoroughly after the upgrade

## Known Issues with Rich Text Editors in Next.js 15 & React 19

With the recent release of Next.js 15 and React 19, several compatibility and integration issues have emerged with popular rich text editors. Below is a summary of the most notable issues, supported by specific examples.

**React-Quill**
- **Not working out of the box**: Users have reported that React-Quill does not work in Next.js 15 paired with React 19. This is partly due to Chrome dropping support for certain features relied upon by older versions of Quill, which React-Quill hasn't updated to accommodate yet. As a workaround, some developers have switched to forks or newer versions (e.g., `react-quill-new`) that address these breaking changes[1].
- **SSR Issues (“document is not defined”)**: Since React-Quill depends on the DOM, integrating it in a server-side rendered (SSR) Next.js app causes errors like “document is not defined.” The community fixes this by dynamically importing the editor with SSR disabled[5].
- **Import/Usage Problems**: Importing React-Quill naively can break Next.js apps; users must often leverage dynamic import with `{ ssr: false }`[4][5].

**Contentful rich-text-react-renderer**
- **Missing React 19 Support**: As of late 2024 and into 2025, `@contentful/rich-text-react-renderer` has not officially added React 19 support. The lack of updated `peerDependencies` and reliance on deprecated APIs (used for rendering modals/dialogs) causes warnings and runtime errors—especially when triggering actions like adding hyperlinks[6][9].
- **Deprecation Warnings**: Even in React 18, users see deprecation warnings. In React 19, parts of the code using outdated methods for attaching React roots break outright, especially for interactive features like modal launchers in the toolbar[9].
- **Community Workarounds**: There is a call from the community for maintainers to migrate to newer React APIs to ensure compatibility[6][9].

**Wix ricos-viewer**
- **Legacy Context API Removed**: When using `ricos-viewer` with React 19, users encounter runtime errors due to the removal of the legacy `childContextTypes` API. Errors such as “I18nextProvider uses the legacy childContextTypes API which was removed in React 19” surface, breaking the editor’s localization features[7].
- **Dependency Issues**: Even with dependencies updated, any packages relying on older context patterns will require significant rewrites. Wrapping components in alternative providers does not resolve this fundamental incompatibility[7].

**General SSR and Integration Pitfalls**
- Many rich text editors are designed for use in the browser and fail during server render. Common symptoms include missing DOM APIs (like `window` or `document`) and hydration errors. The most common workaround is to only load these components client-side via dynamic imports with SSR disabled[5].
- Developers must sometimes adjust properties (such as `immediatelyRender: false`) to suppress SSR-related warnings, as seen in some Next.js rich text editor tutorials[2].

## Common Workarounds

- **Dynamic Import with SSR Disabled:**  
  ```js
  import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';
  const RichTextEditor = dynamic(() => import('react-quill'), { ssr: false });
  ```
- **Switching to Maintained Forks or Alternatives:**  
  Use forks (e.g., `react-quill-new`) or consider alternatives like Slate, SunEditor, or Tiptap, which may have better support and active maintenance for the latest React/Next.js versions[1][4].

## Summary Table: Compatibility Issues

| Editor/Package                        | Next.js 15 + React 19 Status   | Notable Issues                                           | Workaround                                |
|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| React-Quill                           | Broken/needs workaround        | Chrome API removal, SSR errors, import issues            | Use dynamic import, try updated forks     |
| Contentful rich-text-react-renderer    | Not officially supported       | Deprecation/runtime errors (modals, links), warnings     | Await upgrades, monitor peerDeps          |
| Wix ricos-viewer                      | Incompatible                   | Legacy context API removed, localization fails           | None; requires maintainers’ update        |
| General (most editors)                | SSR challenges                 | `document is not defined`, hydration errors              | Dynamic import with SSR off               |

## Final Notes

Upgrading to Next.js 15 and React 19 exposes issues in older or unmaintained rich text editor libraries, primarily around SSR compatibility and deprecated React APIs. The best outcome depends on each package’s support velocity, but in the interim, dynamic imports and exploring alternative editors are the most reliable paths forward[1][5][7][9].

**Ensure RichTextEditorField Compatibility with Next.js 15 & React 19**

The `FIXME: [next15]` marker on `RichTextEditorField` is valid—popular rich-text editors exhibit SSR and deprecated-API breakages in Next.js 15/React 19. Please address the following before removing the TODO:

• Dynamically import any browser-only editor to avoid “document is not defined” errors:  
```js
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';
const RichTextEditor = dynamic(() => import('react-quill'), { ssr: false });
```  
• Upgrade React-Quill to a maintained fork (e.g., `react-quill-new`) or swap in a modern alternative (Slate, Tiptap) to sidestep removed Chrome APIs.  
• Audit `@contentful/rich-text-react-renderer` for missing React 19 support—update to a version with correct `peerDependencies` or pin until fixed.  
• Eliminate legacy Context API usage (e.g., in Wix `ricos-viewer`) or select an actively maintained editor.  
• Add SSR/hydration tests (unit or e2e) to catch runtime and hydration failures post-upgrade.

Once these steps are completed and tested, you can safely clear the `FIXME: [next15]` comment.

**Added pnpm overrides for consistent dependency versions.**

This ensures consistent React 19 types and dependency versions across the codebase, which is essential for this upgrade. The overrides include:
- React types at version 19.1.3
- ESLint at version 9
- TypeScript at version 5
- Specific versions for axios and Prosemirror packages

```shell
#!/bin/bash
# Check that the React and Next.js versions in the editor package match the types specified here

**Align React versions with type definitions override**

The pnpm overrides pin `@types/react` and `@types/react-dom` to **19.1.3**, but in `editor/package.json` you still have:

```json
""react"": ""19.1.0"",
""react-dom"": ""19.1.0"",
```

Please bump these to **19.1.3** (or `^19.1.3`) to match the overrides and avoid any type mismatches.

• File: `editor/package.json`  
  – Update `""react"": ""19.1.0""` → `""react"": ""19.1.3""`  
  – Update `""react-dom"": ""19.1.0""` → `""react-dom"": ""19.1.3""`

**Verify React 19 and Next.js 15 compatibility**

This is a significant upgrade from React 18 to 19 and Next.js 14 to 15. These major version changes may require code adjustments particularly around:
1. React's new `use` hook for promises
2. Next.js routing and server components changes
3. Hydration behavior modifications

Ensure all components have been updated to follow new patterns and best practices.

What are the breaking changes in React 19 and Next.js 15?
```

💡 Result:

## Breaking Changes in React 19

**1. Stricter and Improved StrictMode Behavior**  
React 19 introduces several changes to StrictMode. During development, Strict Mode now double-invokes ref callback functions on initial mount and reuses memoized results from the first render for `useMemo` and `useCallback` during double rendering. This ensures more predictable behavior and helps proactively surface bugs, but can alter how some components behave in development versus production[1].

**2. Server Components Fully Integrated**  
React 19 fully implements Server Components, reducing JavaScript sent to the client and improving performance. This will impact projects that were using experimental APIs, requiring compliance with the updated Server Component specifications[3][7].

**3. Removal and Deprecation of APIs**  
Some legacy APIs have been removed or deprecated in React 19. For instance, in related ecosystems like React Native, `propTypes` and other outdated patterns have now been eliminated[5]. Developers should review deprecations and update their code accordingly[7].

**4. New and Updated Hooks/APIs**  
React 19 introduces new hooks like `useOptimistic` for handling optimistic UI updates, and allows passing `ref` as a prop directly, making `forwardRef` less necessary for many function components. This change may break code that relies on older patterns for handling refs[5].  

**5. Improved Error Boundaries and Debugging Tools**  
React 19’s error boundaries are now more comprehensive, catching a wider range of errors. The new Owner Stack debugging tool also provides deeper insight into component render paths[2].

## Breaking Changes in Next.js 15

| Area                     | Breaking Change                                                                               |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Request APIs             | Many request-specific APIs (`getServerSideProps`, `getStaticProps`, `headers`, `cookies`, etc.) are now asynchronous and require `async/await` even in places where synchronous usage was previously allowed[8][10].         |
| Caching Behavior         | Caching defaults for data and API routes have changed. Developers must review cache strategies as old assumptions may no longer hold[8].      |
| React 19 as Default      | Next.js 15's App Router now defaults to React 19, enforcing the migration to the new version and features. Legacy React 18-only APIs are no longer supported[8].  |
| Deprecated Features      | Several previously deprecated or legacy features have been removed. These may include old Next.js APIs or configuration flags. Developers will need to run codemods and check migration guides[8][6].  |
| Enhanced Forms           | Introduction of the new `next/form` module and `<Form>` component. While this is mostly additive, projects using custom form handling may see breaking changes due to API or internal behavior changes[6].       |
| Turbopack Transition     | Dev server and build tooling have transitioned to Turbopack as the default in development, requiring script updates and potentially surfacing tooling compatibility issues[6][10].   |

---

## Migration Guidance

**For React 19:**
- Review all deprecated APIs and update usages where necessary.
- Test thoroughly in development, especially if you rely on StrictMode for bug detection.
- Refactor any custom ref logic to align with the new prop-passing behavior for refs[5].
- Review error boundary implementations to ensure compatibility.

**For Next.js 15:**
- Refactor all synchronous request-specific APIs to asynchronous forms using `async/await`[8][10].
- Review caching strategies and test data-fetching logic to avoid unexpected behavior[8].
- Upgrade to React 19, testing components for new StrictMode and server rendering behaviors[8].
- Use provided codemods (`npx @next/codemod@canary upgrade latest`) to automate some migration steps and check the official migration guide for manual steps[6].
- Test all forms and routes for compatibility with the new form enhancements and static/dynamic routing indicators[6].

**Next.js 15 & React 19 Upgrade: Review Breaking Changes and Apply Migrations**

In editor/package.json (lines 43–44 and also at 161, 168, 172) you’ve bumped to Next.js 15 (and React 19 by default). These are major upgrades—please address the following breaking changes before merging:

```diff
-  ""@next/mdx"": ""14.x.x"",
-  ""@next/third-parties"": ""14.x.x"",
+  ""@next/mdx"": ""15.3.2"",
+  ""@next/third-parties"": ""15.3.2"",
```

Key areas to update:

• React 19  
  – StrictMode now double-invokes ref callbacks and reuses memoized values; test components under StrictMode and adjust any side-effect logic.  
  – Server Components are fully integrated—ensure any experimental APIs conform to the stable spec.  
  – Legacy APIs removed (e.g., propTypes in React Native); replace or remove deprecated patterns.  
  – New hooks (`useOptimistic`) and direct ref-as-prop support may supersede existing `forwardRef` patterns.  

• Next.js 15  
  – All data-fetching and headers/cookies APIs (`getServerSideProps`, `getStaticProps`, `headers`, `cookies`, etc.) are now async—add `async/await` where needed.  
  – Default caching behavior changed—audit your API and data-fetch routes for proper cache controls.  
  – Legacy React 18-only APIs are removed—verify your components render correctly under React 19.  
  – New `<Form>` component (`next/form`) may conflict with custom form handlers—test form logic.  
  – Dev tooling now uses Turbopack—update any custom scripts or config that reference Webpack.  
  – Run the official codemods (`npx @next/codemod@canary upgrade latest`) and follow the Next.js 15 migration guide.  

Please refactor code patterns accordingly, run your full test suite (including integration tests), and verify in development mode (StrictMode) before deploying.

**ESLint v9 may introduce rule changes**

The upgrade to ESLint v9 might introduce new or changed linting rules. Review your code for any new linting issues and consider updating your ESLint configuration if needed.

---

🌐 Web query:

```web
What are the breaking changes in ESLint v9?
```

💡 Result:

ESLint v9 introduces several breaking changes that may affect your current setup. Here's a summary of the key changes:

**1. Node.js Support:**
- **Dropped Versions:** ESLint v9 no longer supports Node.js versions prior to v18.18.0 and v19.x. ([eslint.org](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/migrate-to-9.0.0?utm_source=openai))

**2. Configuration Format:**
- **Default Format:** The flat configuration (`eslint.config.js`) becomes the default, replacing the older `.eslintrc` files. To continue using `.eslintrc`, set the environment variable `ESLINT_USE_FLAT_CONFIG` to `false`. ([eslint.org](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/migrate-to-9.0.0?utm_source=openai))

**3. Removed Formatters:**
- The following formatters have been removed from the core:
  - `checkstyle`
  - `compact`
  - `jslint-xml`
  - `junit`
  - `tap`
  - `unix`
  - `visualstudio`
  
  If you're using any of these, you'll need to install the respective standalone packages. ([eslint.org](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/migrate-to-9.0.0?utm_source=openai))

**4. Removed Rules:**
- The `require-jsdoc` and `valid-jsdoc` rules have been removed. It's recommended to use the `eslint-plugin-jsdoc` plugin instead. ([eslint.org](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/migrate-to-9.0.0?utm_source=openai))

**5. Updated `eslint:recommended` Configuration:**
- The `eslint:recommended` configuration now includes new rules and removes deprecated ones. Notably, `no-extra-semi`, `no-inner-declarations`, `no-mixed-spaces-and-tabs`, and `no-new-symbol` have been removed. ([eslint.org](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/migrate-to-9.0.0?utm_source=openai))

**6. Changes to Rule Behavior:**
- **`--quiet` Option:** The `--quiet` flag now prevents rules set to `""warn""` from executing, improving performance. ([eslint.org](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/migrate-to-9.0.0?utm_source=openai))
- **`/* eslint */` Comments:** Configuration comments with only severity now retain options from the config file. Multiple comments for the same rule are disallowed. ([eslint.org](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/migrate-to-9.0.0?utm_source=openai))

**7. Stricter Rule Schemas:**
- The `no-constructor-return` and `no-sequences` rules now have stricter schemas. ([eslint.org](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/migrate-to-9.0.0?utm_source=openai))

**8. Code Path Calculations:**
- Code paths are now precalculated before rule traversal, ensuring complete information is available regardless of access point within a rule. ([eslint.org](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/migrate-to-9.0.0?utm_source=openai))

**9. Function-Style Rules Removed:**
- Support for function-style rules (those exporting a function instead of an object with a `create()` method) has been dropped. ([eslint.org](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/migrate-to-9.0.0?utm_source=openai))

**10. `meta.schema` Requirement:**
- Rules that accept options must now define a `meta.schema` property to validate configurations. ([eslint.org](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/migrate-to-9.0.0?utm_source=openai))

**11. `RuleTester` Updates:**
- The `RuleTester` class now enforces stricter checks, including unique suggestion messages and validation of suggestion-generated code. ([eslint.org](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/migrate-to-9.0.0?utm_source=openai))

**12. Integration Changes:**
- The `FlatESLint` class has been renamed to `ESLint`. ([eslint.org](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/migrate-to-9.0.0?utm_source=openai))

For a comprehensive list of breaking changes and migration guidance, refer to the official ESLint migration guide. ([eslint.org](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/migrate-to-9.0.0?utm_source=openai))

**Review ESLint v9 Migration and Breaking Changes**

Upgrading to ESLint v9 introduces several breaking changes you should address:

- **Node.js support dropped** for versions < 18.18.0 and all v19.x.  
  Ensure your local and CI environments run Node ≥ 18.18.0.
- **Flat config (`eslint.config.js`) is now the default.**  
  If you still use `.eslintrc*`, set `ESLINT_USE_FLAT_CONFIG=false` in your environment.
- **Removed core formatters** (`checkstyle`, `compact`, `jslint-xml`, `junit`, `tap`, `unix`, `visualstudio`).  
  Install standalone packages if you rely on any of these.
- **Removed rules**: `require-jsdoc`, `valid-jsdoc`.  
  Migrate to `eslint-plugin-jsdoc` if you need JSDoc enforcement.
- **`eslint:recommended` updated**:  
  - Added new rules and removed deprecated ones (e.g. `no-extra-semi`, `no-inner-declarations`).
- **Rule behavior changes**:  
  - `--quiet` now skips warnings entirely.  
  - `/* eslint */` comments retain full option sets and disallow duplicate comments.
- **Stricter rule schemas** for `no-constructor-return` and `no-sequences`.
- **Function-style rules dropped**; all rules must export an object with `create()`.
- **`meta.schema` is now required** for any rule accepting options.
- **RuleTester** enforces unique suggestion messages and validates fixes.
- **Integration renames**: `FlatESLint` → `ESLint`.

Action Items:
- Review your ESLint configuration files (`.eslintrc*` or `eslint.config.js`) for compatibility.
- Update your CI workflows (e.g., GitHub Actions, Azure Pipelines) to Node ≥ 18.18.0.
- Confirm any custom rules/plugins comply with the new `meta.schema` requirement.
- Adjust any lint-script invocations or tests using `FlatESLint`/`RuleTester`.
- Install standalone formatter packages if needed.

**Consider using an absolute import path for better maintainability.**

This is the fourth occurrence of the same deep relative import path in this PR. This pattern creates maintenance overhead and tight coupling between components.



Consider creating a centralized approach for this type:

```diff
-import type { ProjectMeta } from ""../../../../../team/[team_slug]/[project_slug]/contract/[chainIdOrSlug]/[contractAddress]/types"";
+import type { ProjectMeta } from ""@/types/project-meta"";
```

This would eliminate the fragile relative paths across all affected files.

In

at line 4, replace the deep relative import path for ProjectMeta with an
absolute import path. To fix this, configure a centralized alias or path mapping
in your tsconfig or module resolver that points to the directory containing the
types, then update the import statement to use this alias. This will improve
maintainability by avoiding fragile relative paths repeated across multiple
files.

**Clarify variable naming and data structure.**

The variable is named `team` but the function call is `getProject()`. This naming inconsistency could cause confusion.


Either rename the variable to reflect that it's project data:

```diff
-  const team = await getProject(params.team_slug, params.project_slug);
+  const project = await getProject(params.team_slug, params.project_slug);
```

Or verify that the `getProject` function actually returns team data (in which case the function name might be misleading).

**Fix projectMeta construction**

The `getProject` call returns a `ProjectResponse` (alias `Project`) with:
- `id` → the project’s ID  
- `teamId` → the team’s ID  
- `slug` → the project’s slug  

Currently you’re doing:
```ts
projectMeta: {
  projectSlug: params.project_slug,
  teamId: team.id,        // ← this is the project ID, not the team ID
  teamSlug: team.slug,    // ← this is the project slug, not the team slug
},
```

Suggested changes:
- Use `team.teamId` for the team’s ID
- Use `params.team_slug` for the team’s slug

Example diff:
```diff
- projectMeta: {
-   projectSlug: params.project_slug,
-   teamId: team.id,
-   teamSlug: team.slug,
- },
+ projectMeta: {
+   projectSlug: params.project_slug,
+   teamId: team.teamId,
+   teamSlug: params.team_slug,
+ },
```

Optionally, rename `team` → `project` to make it clear you’re working with a project object.

**Fix team vs. project mix-up in permissions page**

The `team` variable in this page is actually the Project returned by `getProject(…)`, so `team.id` is the **project** ID—not the Team’s. You’ll need to:

• Fetch the Team before or alongside the Project (e.g. via `getTeamBySlug(params.team_slug)`).  
• Rename your variables for clarity (`project = await getProject…`, `team = await getTeamBySlug…`).  
• Use `team.id` / `team.slug` for `teamId`/`teamSlug` in `projectMeta`.

Example change in `apps/dashboard/src/app/(app)/team/[team_slug]/[project_slug]/contract/[chainIdOrSlug]/[contractAddress]/permissions/page.tsx`:

```diff
-export default async function Page(props: { params: Promise<ProjectContractPageParams> }) {
-  const params = await props.params;
-  const team = await getProject(params.team_slug, params.project_slug);
-
-  if (!team) notFound();
+export default async function Page(props: { params: Promise<ProjectContractPageParams> }) {
+  const params = await props.params;
+  // load project and team separately
+  const project = await getProject(params.team_slug, params.project_slug);
+  const team = await getTeamBySlug(params.team_slug);
+
+  if (!team || !project) notFound();

   return (
     <SharedPermissionsPage
       params={{
         contractAddress: params.contractAddress,
         chainIdOrSlug: params.chainIdOrSlug,
-        projectMeta: {
-          projectSlug: params.project_slug,
-          teamId: team.id,
-          teamSlug: team.slug,
-        },
+        projectMeta: {
+          projectSlug: project.slug,
+          teamId: team.id,
+          teamSlug: team.slug,
+        },
       }}
     />
   );
}
```

This ensures `team.id` is the actual Team ID, not the Project’s.

**Over-restrictive token-ID validation blocks legitimate NFTs**

Only decimal-numeric IDs (`/^\d+$/`) are accepted.  
Many ERC-721 / ERC-1155 contracts (e.g. on-chain generative art) use hex or
string IDs — those will be “redirected” and become unreachable.

Consider:

```diff
-function isOnlyNumbers(str: string) {
-  return /^\d+$/.test(str);
-}
+function isValidTokenId(str: string) {
+  // allow decimal, hex (0x…) and base-10 strings
+  return /^(\d+|0x[0-9a-fA-F]+)$/.test(str);
+}
```

or simply skip the validation and let the downstream contract call surface an
error if the token does not exist.  



Also applies to: 81-83

**Broaden token-ID validation to support hex and string IDs**  

The current guard in  
`apps/dashboard/src/app/(app)/(dashboard)/(chain)/[chain_id]/[contractAddress]/nfts/[tokenId]/shared-nfts-token-page.tsx`  
lines 30–40 (and similarly 81–83) only allows decimal digits, which will redirect valid hex-based or string token IDs and make them unreachable.  

Suggested fix: replace `isOnlyNumbers` with a more permissive `isValidTokenId` and update the calls accordingly:

```diff
- function isOnlyNumbers(str: string) {
-   return /^\d+$/.test(str);
- }
+ function isValidTokenId(str: string) {
+   // allow decimal or 0x-prefixed hex IDs
+   return /^(\d+|0x[0-9A-Fa-f]+)$/.test(str);
+ }
```

Then in lines 30–40 and 81–83, change:

```diff
- if (!isOnlyNumbers(params.tokenId)) {
+ if (!isValidTokenId(params.tokenId)) {
```

This ensures on-chain NFTs using hex or other string IDs remain reachable.  
Alternatively, remove the frontend guard entirely and let the backend/contract call handle invalid IDs.

`getClientThirdwebClient` is imported from a file that (by convention) ends with `.client`.

**Off-by-one bug causes modules list to be dropped when it is the first arg**

`findIndex` returns `0` when the matching parameter is the first in the `_initialize` signature.  
Because `0` is falsy, the ternary expression incorrectly treats it as “not found”, so `modules`
ends up as `undefined` even though the argument was located.

```diff
-const moduleIndex = initializeFunction.inputs.findIndex(
-  (i) => i.name === ""_modules"" || i.name === ""modules"",

**`chainSlug.toString()` may generate `""undefined""` — fallback to chain id**  

`useChainSlug` can legitimately return `undefined` for unrecognised chains. Casting that to a string yields the literal `""undefined""` which will be embedded in the URL produced by `buildContractPagePath`, producing links like  
`/undefined/…/nfts/123`.  This breaks navigation and SEO.

```diff

This guarantees a valid slug even when the helper cannot map the chain, aligning behaviour with the legacy template-literal implementation.  
Please verify other call-sites that pass `chainSlug.toString()` in a similar fashion.

**`projectMeta` is not forwarded to the Explorer page components**  

Both `ContractExplorerPageClient` and `ContractExplorerPage` receive no `projectMeta` prop, whereas the other newly-added shared pages consistently forward it.  
If either client or server explorer page needs to build paths with `buildContractPagePath`, breadcrumbs, etc., this omission will break project-scoped navigation/links.

```diff
-      <ContractExplorerPageClient
-        contract={clientContract}
-        chainMetadata={chainMetadata}
-        isLoggedIn={props.isLoggedIn}
-      />
+      <ContractExplorerPageClient
+        contract={clientContract}
+        chainMetadata={chainMetadata}
+        isLoggedIn={props.isLoggedIn}
+        projectMeta={props.projectMeta}
+      />
```

and likewise for the SSR component below.

Please verify the explorer page API and pass the prop if required.

**Add projectMeta prop to Explorer page components and forward it**

Both `ContractExplorerPageClient` and `ContractExplorerPage` currently don’t accept a `projectMeta` prop, but for consistency with other shared pages and to support project-scoped links in the future, we should:

• apps/dashboard/src/app/(app)/(dashboard)/(chain)/[chain_id]/[contractAddress]/explorer/ContractExplorerPage.client.tsx  
  – Extend `ContractExplorePageProps` to include `projectMeta?: ProjectMeta`.  
  – Destructure `projectMeta` and pass it to `<ContractExplorerPage>`.  
• apps/dashboard/src/app/(app)/(dashboard)/(chain)/[chain_id]/[contractAddress]/explorer/ContractExplorerPage.tsx  
  – Extend `ContractExplorePageProps` to include `projectMeta?: ProjectMeta`.  
  – Destructure it; if downstream components (e.g. navigation links) need it, forward accordingly.  
• apps/dashboard/src/app/(app)/(dashboard)/(chain)/[chain_id]/[contractAddress]/explorer/shared-explorer-page.tsx  
  – Forward `props.projectMeta` into both `<ContractExplorerPageClient>` and `<ContractExplorerPage>`.

**Early-return after redirect to avoid double-rendering**

`redirectToContractLandingPage` is invoked but the function continues executing, so React may still attempt to render `<ContractAnalyticsPage>` right after the redirect exception is thrown, which can lead to confusing stack traces and makes the intent unclear to readers / TS.  
Guard the call with an explicit `return` so the control-flow is obvious and TS can infer `never` if the helper doesn’t already do so.

```diff
   if (!isInsightSupported) {

```
In app/views/home/shared/_discovery_category.html.erb lines 1 to 36, the marquee
rows have repetitive code structures that violate the DRY principle. Refactor by
extracting the marquee row rendering logic into a reusable partial or helper
method that accepts the tags and icons as parameters, then call this partial or
helper for each marquee row to eliminate duplication and improve
maintainability.

**Add accessibility considerations for marquee animations.**

Continuous marquee animations can cause vestibular disorders and motion sickness for some users. Consider adding `prefers-reduced-motion` support.

marquee animation can cause motion sickness for some users. Update the animation
classes to use Tailwind's motion-safe and motion-reduce utilities by wrapping
the animation in motion-safe and disabling or reducing it in motion-reduce.
Also, verify that Tailwind's configuration supports these utilities to respect

**Fix semantic mismatch between icons and tags.**

The icon array doesn't semantically correspond to the tags it's paired with. For example, ""blender"" might be paired with a ""comics.svg"" icon due to the modulo cycling. This creates confusing user experience.



Consider either:
1. Creating a proper mapping between tags and their semantic icons
2. Using a single generic icon for all tags
3. Implementing logic to match tags to appropriate category icons

```diff
-<% first_row_icons = [""discover/animation.svg"", ""discover/design.svg"", ...] %>
-<%= image_tag first_row_icons[index % first_row_icons.length], %>
+<% tag_to_icon = {
+  ""blender"" => ""discover/3d.svg"",
+  ""meditation"" => ""discover/audio.svg"",
+  ""comic"" => ""discover/comics.svg""
+} %>
+<%= image_tag tag_to_icon[tag_obj[:tag]] || ""discover/generic.svg"", %>

```
In app/views/home/shared/_discovery_category.html.erb around lines 23 to 32, the
icons in the first_row_icons array do not semantically match the tags they are
paired with, causing user confusion. Fix this by creating a proper mapping
between each tag and its corresponding icon, replacing the current array and
modulo logic with a hash or dictionary that directly associates each tag with
the correct icon file. Update the image_tag call to use this mapping to ensure
icons accurately represent their tags.

**Add validation for mutually exclusive options.**

The `start` command accepts three mutually exclusive options (`--name`, `--path`, `--remote-character`) but doesn't enforce that only one is provided. This could cause confusion.


Consider adding validation to ensure exactly one option is provided:

```diff
  .action(async (options) => {

</details>

**Attention:** The regex patterns for dynamic error messages need some adjustments:

- The pattern for authentication failures is triggering an ""Invalid range end"" error—likely because of how the apostrophe (and possibly the hyphen) is used within the character class. Please revise the escaping or ordering of special characters (e.g., consider placing the hyphen at the start or end of the class or escaping the apostrophe) so that tools like `grep` can parse it correctly.
- Additionally, ensure that these patterns remain sufficiently restrictive to prevent unintentional information leakage while still matching only the intended legitimate messages.

Please address these concerns and perform manual verification to confirm that the revised regex patterns behave as expected.

**Consider returning an error instead of panicking.**

The `panic` on line 228 for unknown alias tags could crash the application. Consider returning a default cache or an error instead.

Apply this diff to handle unknown alias tags gracefully:

```diff
-func getFieldCache(aliasTag string) *sync.Map {
+func getFieldCache(aliasTag string) (*sync.Map, error) {
 	switch aliasTag {
 	case ""header"":
-		return &headerFieldCache
+		return &headerFieldCache, nil
 	case ""respHeader"":
-		return &respHeaderFieldCache
+		return &respHeaderFieldCache, nil
 	case ""cookie"":
-		return &cookieFieldCache
+		return &cookieFieldCache, nil
 	case ""form"":
-		return &formFieldCache
+		return &formFieldCache, nil
 	case ""uri"":
-		return &uriFieldCache
+		return &uriFieldCache, nil
 	case ""query"":

+		return &queryFieldCache, nil
 	}
 
-	panic(""unknown alias tag: "" + aliasTag)
+	return nil, fmt.Errorf(""unknown alias tag: %s"", aliasTag)
 }
```

You'll also need to update the `equalFieldType` function to handle the error:

```diff
-	cache := getFieldCache(aliasTag)
+	cache, err := getFieldCache(aliasTag)
+	if err != nil {
+		return false
+	}
```

In binder/mapping.go around lines 212 to 229, the function getFieldCache
currently panics when an unknown aliasTag is encountered, which can crash the
application. Modify getFieldCache to return an additional error value instead of
panicking, returning a nil cache and an error describing the unknown aliasTag.
Update all callers of getFieldCache, including equalFieldType, to handle this
error gracefully by checking the error and responding appropriately rather than
assuming a valid cache is always returned.

**Fix formatting issues and document the pattern size choice.**

The SIMD optimization looks good, but there are formatting issues that need to be addressed. Additionally, the choice of 5 pixels for the pattern size should be documented.


Run `cargo fmt` to fix the formatting issues:
```shell

cargo fmt
```

Consider adding a comment explaining why 5 pixels was chosen for the pattern size:
```diff

Not quite,  `NODE_OPTIONS` is a hatch door that works for all `node` executions. It is just that sometimes user might not be able to modify the command line arguments when they run `node` (it is from 3rd party which could be out from their control). But they can predefine `NODE_OPTIONS` to influence what would be applied to `node` command later.

And it happened to be the case that we only need to specify ""--import=weave/instrument"" for ESM project, CommonJS doesn't require anything. But that's not strictly mean `NODE_OPTIONS` wouldn't apply to commonjs project. CommonJS can still specify `NODE_OPTIONS`, it is just that specifying ""--import=weave/instrument"" for CommonJS wound't really do anything."

Those you add is problematic because 
1. the api version value YYYY-MM-DD format has been reviewed and approved by the SDK team as well as ARM team. but the version in your prefix like v1 v2 are not. Which means it would be randomly changed by your team and this kind of impact hasn't been properly evaluated.

**Extracted conditional rendering into dedicated function**

The new `renderSelectDeriveTypeItem` function improves code organization by separating the rendering logic for derive type items. This makes the component more maintainable and easier to understand.

The function intelligently handles different states:
- Returns null during loading or when not in select mode
- Shows balance information for existing accounts
- Shows an add icon for new accounts

2517298451,2115431624,sandy081,,,I think I got another better idea. Inline the logic of `syncMissingFromGallery` in `syncInstalledExtensionsWithGallery`. This means while syncing installed extensions with gallery you also update the missing gallery extensions. Logically they belong together so it makes sense to compute them together.
2517298451,2116164192,joshspicer,,,"Here's why I didn't inline it:

In order to compute `syncMissingFromGallery`, we need to know all of the locally installed extensions (`infos`) that _produced_ the `galleryExtensions`.  

If we don't use `infos` as a filter, then we over-count extensions as 'missing' here:

**Good improvement to use `findByRole` directly, but consider consistency.**

The change from `waitFor(() => canvas.getByRole(...))` to `canvas.findByRole(..., { timeout: 30000 })` is a good improvement that follows Testing Library best practices. However, there are two consistency concerns:

1. **Inconsistent pattern**: Line 653 in `EditMultilevelTaxonomy` performs the same operation but still uses the old `waitFor` pattern:
```typescript
const editButton = await waitFor(() => canvas.getByRole('button', { name: 'Edit My Taxonomy' }));
```

2. **Inconsistent timeout**: The 30-second timeout is much longer than the 2-second timeouts used elsewhere in the file (lines 55, 79, 241, 565).




Consider applying the same pattern to line 653 for consistency:

```diff
-const editButton = await waitFor(() => canvas.getByRole('button', { name: 'Edit My Taxonomy' }));
+const editButton = await canvas.findByRole('button', { name: 'Edit My Taxonomy' }, { timeout: 30000 });
```

If the longer timeout is specifically needed for these taxonomy tests, consider documenting why or standardizing the timeout across similar operations.

pattern with an explicit timeout as used at line 699 for consistency. Also,
review the timeout values used across the file (notably 2 seconds elsewhere) and
either standardize the timeout duration for these role queries or add comments
explaining why a longer timeout (e.g., 30 seconds) is necessary for these
taxonomy-related tests.

**Critical: Migration Warnings & NOT NULL Columns Without Defaults**

The initial comment block lists several warnings about adding required (NOT NULL) columns without default values. This may lead to migration failures on non-empty tables. Ensure you either migrate on an empty table, supply default values, or adopt a two-step migration (first add nullable columns, populate data, then alter to NOT NULL) to avoid runtime issues in production.

---



</details>

**Action Required: Resolve Migration Warnings for Non-Empty Tables**

The migration script currently adds several NOT NULL columns without providing default values and introduces a unique constraint on `[taskId, employeeId]` for the `VendorTaskAssignment` table. If any of these tables already contain data, these changes may lead to migration failures. Please ensure that you either:

- **Migrate on an empty table**, or
- **Supply default values** for the new NOT NULL columns, or
- **Adopt a two-step migration strategy** where the columns are first added as nullable, data is populated, and then the columns are altered to NOT NULL.

**Critical issue: Cache lacks shape and device validation.**

The Gumbel sampling implementation is mathematically correct, but the caching strategy has a critical flaw: there's no validation that the cached Gumbel noise tensor matches the current `log_probs` in terms of shape or device.



This could cause runtime errors when:
1. Different vocabulary sizes are used between calls
2. Tensors are on different devices
3. Batch sizes change

Apply this fix to validate cache compatibility:

```diff
 // Generate cached Gumbel noise (-log(-log(u))) once.
 let gumbel = {
     let mut guard = self.gumbel_cache.lock().unwrap();
-    if guard.is_none() {
+    let needs_regeneration = guard.as_ref().map_or(true, |cached| {
+        cached.shape() != log_probs.shape() || cached.device() != log_probs.device()
+    });
+    
+    if needs_regeneration {
         let uniform = Tensor::rand(0f32, 1f32, log_probs.shape(), log_probs.device())?;
         let noise = uniform
             .clamp(1e-20, 1.0)?
             .log()? // ln(u)
             .neg()? // -ln(u)
             .log()? // ln(-ln(u))
             .neg()?; // -ln(-ln(u))
         *guard = Some(noise);
     }
     guard.as_ref().unwrap().clone()
 };
```

```
In mistralrs-core/src/sampler.rs around lines 420 to 439, the cached Gumbel
noise tensor is used without validating that its shape and device match the
current log_probs tensor, which can cause runtime errors if vocabulary size,
device, or batch size changes. To fix this, add checks after locking the cache
to verify if the cached tensor exists and whether its shape and device match
log_probs; if not, regenerate and replace the cached noise tensor accordingly
before using it.

The use case is quite specific and adding it would increase complexity for limited benefit. Instead, Shortest should just pass-through a custom fetch method via the config.
We can propose your solution in the docs for reference, but ultimately the user has the freedom to implement what works for them.

A config that uses the custom `fetch` would look something like this:

```typescript
import type { ShortestConfig } from ""@antiwork/shortest"";
import { setGlobalDispatcher, EnvHttpProxyAgent } from ""undici"";

if (process.env.HTTPS_PROXY || process.env.HTTP_PROXY) {

Thank you for your comment.
I thought your suggestion was correct, so I reflected the settings in `shortest.config.ts.example` .
Also, I found that the AI SDK uses the global `fetch` function if nothing is passed to the `fetch` argument in `createAnthropic` function, so it works without explicitly specifying it in the arguments. Therefore, I reverted `provider.ts` to its original state."

# Refactor: Replace LangChainManager class with functional approach

## Overview
Refactored the `LangChainManager` class to use a functional approach, making the code simpler and more maintainable.

## Changes

### 1. Class Removal
**Before:**
```typescript
class LangChainManager {
  getAgent(agentName: string) {
    switch (agentName) {
      case 'databaseSchemaAskAgent':
        return agents.databaseSchemaAskAgent
      case 'databaseSchemaBuildAgent':
        return agents.databaseSchemaBuildAgent
      default:
        return null
    }
  }
}
export const langchain = new LangChainManager()
```

**After:**
```typescript
export type AgentName = keyof typeof agents
export const getAgent = (agentName: AgentName) => agents[agentName]
```

### 2. Improved Type Safety
- Defined `AgentName` type as `keyof typeof agents` for type safety
- Removed switch statement in favor of direct object access
- Eliminated need for `default` case (guaranteed by TypeScript type system)

### 3. Simplified Error Handling
**Before:**
```typescript
const agent = langchain.getAgent(agentName)
if (!agent) {
  throw new Error(`${agentName} not found in LangChain instance`)
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
const agent = getAgent(agentName)
// Type system guarantees agent always exists
```

### 4. Centralized Type Definitions
- Defined and exported `AgentName` type in `lib/langchain/index.ts`
- Removed duplicate type definition from `workflow/types.ts`
- Ensured type consistency across the codebase

## Benefits

1. **Simplicity**: No class instantiation required
2. **Type Safety**: Leverages TypeScript's type system to the fullest
3. **Maintainability**: Removed redundant switch statements and null checks
4. **Consistency**: Unified functional approach
5. **Performance**: Faster object access instead of method calls

## Impact
- `chatProcessor.ts`: `langchain.getAgent()` → `getAgent()`
- `answerGenerationNode.ts`: Updated similarly
- `workflow.test.ts`: Updated mocks
- `types.ts`: Unified `AgentName` type import source

This refactoring maintains the Command pattern-like structure while adopting a more functional and simpler approach.

**Pass a number, not a string, to `startServer`**  

`startServer`’s first parameter is inferred as `number` (default comes from `getDefaultPort(): number`).  
Commander yields a string unless a parser is supplied, so `cmdObj.port` is very likely `""3000""` here.  
Casting once avoids silent widening and keeps type-safety.

```diff
-          await startServer(cmdObj.port, browserBehavior);
+          await startServer(Number(cmdObj.port), browserBehavior);

**Convert `cmdObj.port` to a number when calling `startServer`**  

Commander parses option values as strings (our default is `getDefaultPort().toString()`), but `startServer(port: number, …)` expects a numeric port. Passing a string causes Node’s HTTP server to treat it as a socket path instead of a TCP port. Cast once to keep type-safety and guarantee the HTTP listener binds correctly.

• File: `src/redteam/commands/setup.ts` at the `await startServer(cmdObj.port, browserBehavior);` call  
```diff
- await startServer(cmdObj.port, browserBehavior);
+ await startServer(Number(cmdObj.port), browserBehavior);

**Unnecessary repeated writes inside concurrent loop**

`this.evalRecord.addPrompts(prompts)` is now executed inside every iteration of the `forEachOfLimit` loop.  
For large evaluations this results in dozens/hundreds of identical DB UPDATEs and file-watch events, hurting performance without functional gain.

```diff
- await this.evalRecord.addPrompts(prompts);
+ // Only update once per batch – prompts don’t change
+ if (index === 0) {
+   await this.evalRecord.addPrompts(prompts);
+ }
```

Alternatively, remove the call entirely – prompts were already persisted earlier (line 659) and again at the very end (line 1413).

In src/evaluator.ts around lines 1297 to 1298, the call to
this.evalRecord.addPrompts(prompts) inside the forEachOfLimit loop causes
redundant database updates and file-watch events, degrading performance. Remove
this call from the loop entirely since prompts are already persisted earlier at
line 659 and again at line 1413, eliminating unnecessary repeated writes without
affecting functionality.

2588154590,2145423005,coderabbitai[bot],,,"@sklein12 Got it—thanks for pointing that out. Since `processEvalStep` mutates each prompt’s metrics, persisting the updated `prompts` array right after every step is required for real-time stats and UI updates, so the existing `await this.evalRecord.addPrompts(prompts)` inside the loop is justified. I retract the earlier optimization suggestion. If performance ever becomes a bottleneck we could look into batching or throttling the writes, but that’s outside the scope of this change.

2264844488,1909212563,aaronburtle,,,"`request-body-strict` is used to indicate whether or not we are being ""strict"" with what is allowed to be included in the request body when we make a POST PUT or PATCH. Jerry gives an example how of this looks to the user in this issue: https://github.com/Azure/data-api-builder/issues/2463?reload=1?reload=1

But the basic idea is that if you have some object that you want to do one of the above operations with to your DB, the request-body-strict being set to false allows you to do that operation without first removing the primary keys from that object. From the issue linked above:

**Safely embed JSON in HTML attributes**  
Rails escapes HTML in `<%= %>` by default, converting quotes to `&quot;` and breaking `element.dataset.settings`. Use `json_escape` (or mark as `html_safe`) to embed unescaped JSON:

```diff
-    <div id=""design-settings"" data-settings=""<%= custom_context[:design_settings].to_json %>"" style=""display: none;""></div>
-    <div id=""user-agent-info"" data-settings=""<%= custom_context[:user_agent_info].to_json %>"" style=""display: none;""></div>

What does Rails json_escape helper do and when should it be used?
```

💡 Result:

## What the `json_escape` Helper Does

The Rails `json_escape` helper (available as `ERB::Util#json_escape`) is a utility method that escapes certain HTML-sensitive characters in JSON strings, converting them into Unicode escape sequences. This ensures that when JSON data is embedded directly into HTML or JavaScript in a web page, special characters like `<`, `>`, `&`, and certain line separators are transformed into their safe Unicode forms (e.g., `<` becomes `\u003C`)[1][2][3].

This escaping is intended to prevent security issues such as cross-site scripting (XSS) when JSON data is inserted into `<script>` tags or HTML attributes, and a user’s data could contain characters that would break out of the intended context or create executable code. The mapping applied by `json_escape` is:

- `&` → `\u0026`
- `>` → `\u003E`
- `<` → `\u003C`
- U+2028 and U+2029 (line/paragraph separators) are also escaped[2].

## Example Usage

A common pattern is:
```erb
<script>
  var currentUser = <%= raw json_escape(current_user.to_json) %>;
</script>
```
Here, `json_escape` transforms problematic characters so they cannot be interpreted as HTML tags or script breaks, and `raw` is used to prevent Rails from double-escaping the output[1].

## When Should `json_escape` Be Used?

Use `json_escape` when:

- You are embedding JSON directly into HTML or JavaScript, especially inside `<script>` tags, and the data could contain user input or other untrusted data.
- You are unsure if the JSON string was generated with HTML entity escaping enabled (e.g., with `ActiveSupport.escape_html_entities_in_json` set to `true`). Applying `json_escape` is idempotent, so double-escaping is safe[1][2].
- You are using JSON generation gems or libraries that may not provide automatic HTML entity escaping by default.

You typically do **not** need `json_escape` when:

- The JSON is being sent as a server response body (e.g., in a Rails API controller’s `render json:`), not embedded in HTML/JS[5].
- You are inserting JSON into HTML attributes, as most Rails helpers will handle escaping automatically[1].

## Warnings and Caveats

- Only use `json_escape` on valid JSON strings. Applying it to non-JSON (e.g., raw user input) can introduce vulnerabilities instead of preventing them[1].
- Rails 4+ escapes HTML entities in JSON by default, but `to_json` can be overridden or settings can change, so explicit use of `json_escape` is sometimes the safer choice[2].
- When displaying JSON in HTML attributes, Rails will generally escape values properly without needing `json_escape`[1].

## Summary Table

| When to Use `json_escape`    | When Not to Use |
|-----------------------------|-----------------|
| Embedding JSON in `<script>` (with user data) | Rendering JSON API/response bodies         |
| Unsure of JSON origin or auto-escaping        | Inserting JSON into HTML attributes (auto-escaped) |
| Using non-standard JSON serializers           |                                            |

**In short:**  
`json_escape` escapes HTML-sensitive characters in JSON strings to prevent XSS when embedding JSON in HTML/JavaScript. Use it for direct `<script>` embedding or when unsure of string safety[1][2][3].

**Properly escape JSON for HTML data attributes**  
Rails’s default `<%= %>` HTML-escapes quotes (turning `""` into `&quot;`), which breaks parsing when you read `element.dataset.settings`. You need to produce a raw JSON string or properly HTML-escape quotes in the attribute.

Locations:  
- app/views/layouts/application.html.erb (around lines 11–12)

Suggested fixes (pick one):

Option 1: single-quote the attribute and output raw JSON  
```erb
-   <div id=""design-settings"" data-settings=""<%= custom_context[:design_settings].to_json %>"" style=""display: none;""></div>
-   <div id=""user-agent-info"" data-settings=""<%= custom_context[:user_agent_info].to_json %>"" style=""display: none;""></div>
+   <div id=""design-settings"" data-settings='<%= raw(custom_context[:design_settings].to_json) %>' style=""display: none;""></div>
+   <div id=""user-agent-info"" data-settings='<%= raw(custom_context[:user_agent_info].to_json) %>' style=""display: none;""></div>
```

Option 2: HTML-escape the JSON string (quotes become `&quot;`)  
```erb
-   <div id=""design-settings"" data-settings=""<%= custom_context[:design_settings].to_json %>"" style=""display: none;""></div>
-   <div id=""user-agent-info"" data-settings=""<%= custom_context[:user_agent_info].to_json %>"" style=""display: none;""></div>
+   <div id=""design-settings"" data-settings=""<%= html_escape(custom_context[:design_settings].to_json) %>"" style=""display: none;""></div>
+   <div id=""user-agent-info"" data-settings=""<%= html_escape(custom_context[:user_agent_info].to_json) %>"" style=""display: none;""></div>
```

Either approach ensures `dataset.settings` returns a valid JSON string.

```
In app/views/layouts/application.html.erb around lines 11 to 12, the JSON
embedded in the data-settings attributes is HTML-escaped by default, causing
quotes to become &quot; and breaking JavaScript access via
element.dataset.settings. To fix this, either wrap the JSON output in raw() and
use single quotes around the attribute value, or explicitly HTML-escape the JSON
string with html_escape(). Choose one approach to ensure the JSON string is
correctly parsed by JavaScript.

That sounds more like metadata describing a trace rather than metadata describing an event. Do you want me to add an OptionalMetadata list onto the TraceBlock so that you can throw key/value pairs in there?
"
2325133961,1950556562,noahfalk,,,Updated the PR with a Key/Value pair for event metadata. We could do the same thing for TraceBlock if folks think it would be useful.

2325133961,1951586542,brianrob,,,Clarifying question here - I see that indices into the ThreadBlock are only valid between the ThreadBlock and a SequencePointBlock.  Do we expect there to be another ThreadBlock immediately after a SequencePointBlock that may contain data from the previous ThreadBlock if subsequent events need to reference previously used process/thread values?
2325133961,1951591686,brianrob,,,"In the case of more complex types (e.g. objects), the format seems to support nested objects (objects within objects).  I'd expect this to be supported given that this is used in TraceLogging events.  Just want to make sure that you do expect this to be supported."

2325133961,1951686300,noahfalk,,,"Yeah, I expect it will be common that a (thread,process) tuple is long-lived so many ThreadBlocks will re-introduce it after each sequence point. Its a tradeoff where the file format gets a little more verbose in exchange for not asking the reader to cache every thread it has ever seen in the trace.

I'm guessing ThreadBlocks would comprise ~0.01% of the total file content in a typical trace and maybe ~0.1% in a trace with 1000+ threads in it."
2325133961,1951699594,noahfalk,,,Let me know if you guys don't think we should make this recommendation. As far as I could tell PerfView doesn't care what the value of this field is right now so practically it seemed unused. From a file format perspective it felt limiting if the metadata constrains us to only defining CPU sampling and only one rate for the entire file. For example a trace might have the OS doing CPU sampling at rate R1 and .NET runtime doing thread-time sampling at rate R2 and any number of other things also creating events from their own independent sampling mechanisms. Including expected rates as event metadata or as some initial event in the trace appeared like a more flexible mechanism.
2325133961,1951739873,noahfalk,,,Key/Value pairs are added to the spec in the latest PR update. I also took the liberty of removing a few of the Trace object fields converting them to semantic conventions on the key/value pairs. I can return any or all of them to be explicit format fields if folks think that is preferable. My rationale for converting them is that they weren't required for parsing anything else in the format and I could imagine traces where those pieces of data weren't relevant for a user interpreting the trace. It seemed nice not to force writers to fill in data if the data didn't matter to them.

2325133961,1951757989,brianrob,,,"I think it's reasonable to not have the format care about this particular field - I'd just be inclined to have one-collect write out an event with the metadata that it wants to export, and then tools like PerfView and TraceEvent can expose it.  Thinking a bit further, my point here is more that I think knowing the expected rate is interesting - I agree that it doesn't need to be/probably shouldn't be tied to the serialization format."

2325133961,1975058304,lateralusX,,,"This TraceBlock is currently emitted at the beginning of the stream. If the idea is to include multiple processes in the same stream, then I believe it wouldn't make much sense to have any process specific information in this record, only stuff that is shared between all processes included in the trace. Since some of the information is tied specifically to a process, like process id, CPU sampling rate (could in theory be different for each dotnet process), maybe it make sense to emit a ProcessBlock in the stream with additional process specific metadata, I believe that block only need to be emitted once in the stream, before first use of the process id, in for example the ThreadBlock. It's an option to put an index representing the process id in that record and then use that in the ThreadBlock, but that will probably not be necessary, pid_t is normally 32-bit and currently an uint32_t in EventPipe, it will mainly be referenced through the new ThreadBlock that will appear once per thread between sequence points, so using the full uint32_t process id is probably good enough."
2325133961,1975070585,lateralusX,,,"I understand that this is just making the format multi-process aware, but how do we envision this to be used? Currently each EventPipe session owns the whole stream, and there is plenty of state included serializing the stream, like caching stack traces, sequence point management, compression etc. If we would like to include multiple processes in the same session stream, then I would assume each EventPipe session would just store the raw events into memory, similar to how buffer manager currently does it internally and then have an external trace process that could trace multiple dotnet processes at the same time (getting access to the raw buffers), meaning that the trace process will take care of most of the serialization currently done in the per session EventPipe serialization layer?"
2325133961,1975084426,lateralusX,,,"Since this index must be unique for all events emitted between SequencePoints and if we could include events from multiple processes inside the same SequencePoint range, then the creation and handling of this block must be done by the process responsible to merge all events coming in from all traced processes into the nettrace stream. Each EventPipe session can't handle this since there will likely be index collision between different processes included in the same nettrace file."
2325133961,1975095419,noahfalk,,,"I wanted to balance support for having multiple processes while still letting things be simple/efficient for traces that do only have one process. My expectation is that when the runtime emits a single process trace it will set the ProcessId key, but in a multi-process trace the key will be absent and each thread will specify the process id separately. I expect it will be helpful for some readers to know up-front if they are dealing with a multi-process trace rather than needing to scan every thread in the trace to discover that only one process ever appears.

I've not seen an example where CPU sampling rate varied by process but I also made that one optional for similar reasoning that maybe there won't be a single global rate. If the rate did vary I think varying by process is one possibility but there are others such as vary by time or multiple distinct sampling rates are occurring simultaneously. If we create a ProcessBlock and put CPU sampling rate it would handle per-process rates well, but wouldn't handle any of those other cases. It seemed easier to leave our choice of how to encode this to our future selves. I think we have options that wouldn't require any format changes such as emitting a well-defined event once-per-process that sets the rate or encoding multiple rates in a differently named Key-Value pair."
2325133961,1975101988,noahfalk,,,The background context here is that we are planning to create a Linux profiling tool (based on perf_events and user_events) that will be doing full machine profiling. We wanted an open data format to write the trace info into that PerfView already had decent support for so we thought nettrace would be a good option. In this scenario it won't be EventPipe creating the data at all. At the moment there is no plan for EventPipe to create a multi-process trace.
2325133961,1975114863,lateralusX,,,"In EventPipe the thread id is a uint64_t sized value, but currently our TraceEvent handles it as int, https://github.com/microsoft/perfview/issues/1446. This has caused issues with negative thread id's showing up in perfview, there are other platforms that typedef pthread_t to a pointer (iOS/tvOS/MacCatalyst/MacOS), so thread id will be truncated on these platforms as well. If we change the file format, I also believe we should try to enhance libraries parsing this data to either switch to a wider data type for thread id, or utilize the index as an indirection to get to the full thread id and process id."
2325133961,1975121389,noahfalk,,,No plan right now to have EventPipe do any merging or generate a multi-process trace. I agree that if we did ever want a scenario that took multiple single-process traces and merged them together it would require the merge to do substantial work with the current format. In addition to thread indexes there would also be collisions on metadata ids and stack ids + all the events would have to spliced together with specific ordering to obey the format's timestamp ordering rules.

legitimately zero, preventing proper initialization. Replace this check with a
boolean flag that tracks whether the start values have been set, and use this
flag to ensure the values are only initialized once regardless of their numeric
values.

**Use `clearInterval` instead of `clearTimeout` for consistency**

The parameter is named `intervalId` which suggests it contains a timer interval ID, but the code uses `clearTimeout`. For consistency and correctness, use `clearInterval` instead.

In src/watch-input.internal.ts around lines 27 to 29, the code uses clearTimeout
to clear a timer stored in intervalId.current, but since the variable name
suggests it is an interval ID, replace clearTimeout with clearInterval to
correctly clear the interval timer.

While SourceContentPart is correctly added to ThreadAssistantContentPart, it's not included in CoreAssistantContentPart (lines 246-248).

Consider adding a comment explaining why SourceContentPart is not included in CoreAssistantContentPart:

**❌ Breaking Change: IModalAssetListParamList removal impacts AssetList module**

The removal will break several components that depend on these params:
- packages/kit/src/views/AssetList/pages/TokenManagerModal.tsx
- packages/kit/src/views/AssetList/pages/TokenList.tsx
- packages/kit/src/views/AssetList/pages/AddCustomTokenModal.tsx

Consider keeping IModalAssetListParamList or providing a migration path for the AssetList module.

**Remove duplicate route configuration**

The `TabHomeUrlAccountPage` route appears in both `urlAccountRoutes` and `homeRouters`. This creates maintenance overhead and potential conflicts.

Choose one of these approaches:
1. Keep the route only in `homeRouters`
2. Move it to `urlAccountRoutes` and reference it in `homeRouters`

```diff
 export const urlAccountRoutes = [
   {
     name: ETabHomeRoutes.TabHomeUrlAccountPage,
     component: UrlAccountPageContainer,
+    exact: true,
   },
 ];

 export const homeRouters: ITabSubNavigatorConfig<any, any>[] = [
   {
     name: ETabHomeRoutes.TabHome,
     component: HomePageContainer,
     rewrite: '/',
     headerShown: !platformEnv.isNative,
   },
   {
     name: ETabHomeRoutes.TabHomeUrlAccountLanding,
     component: UrlAccountLanding,
     rewrite: urlAccountLandingRewrite,
     exact: true,

The type assertion `data as EmailWebhookBodySchema` assumes that the `data` object, derived from the form data, perfectly matches the `EmailWebhookBodySchema`. This could lead to runtime errors if the form data is missing fields or has incorrect types. Consider validating the `data` object against the schema before using it to ensure type safety and prevent unexpected behavior.

```typescript
const result = emailWebhookBodySchema.safeParse(data);
if (!result.success) {
  console.error(""Validation error:"", result.error.format());

_⚠️ Potential issue_

**Consider implementing selective property assignment for consistency and safety.**

Unlike the `beforeAll` case which selectively copies properties, the `beforeEach` implementation assigns the entire returned `test` object. This could allow extensions to:
- Remove required properties from the test object
- Add unexpected properties that might interfere with downstream processing

Consider implementing selective property assignment similar to the `beforeAll` case to maintain consistency and provide a safety barrier.

**Test confirms the risk of accepting invalid test objects.**

This test demonstrates that the `beforeEach` hook will accept and return invalid values (like a string) as the test object. This reinforces my earlier concern about the lack of defensive coding in the `beforeEach` implementation compared to `beforeAll`.

When downstream code expects `test` to be an object with properties like `vars` and `assert`, receiving a string will likely cause runtime errors.

In test/evaluatorHelpers.test.ts around lines 718 to 727, the test shows that
the beforeEach hook accepts invalid context values like a string instead of an
object, which can cause runtime errors downstream. To fix this, add defensive
checks in the beforeEach implementation to validate that the context is an
object with the expected properties before returning it, and handle or reject
invalid inputs appropriately to prevent propagation of malformed test objects.

- Commit-hash based versioning makes it unclear what functionality is being included
- This appears to be a preview/development version, which may not be suitable for production
- Dependency management becomes more complex




Please verify if there's a published npm version available:

```shell
#!/bin/bash
# Check if vitepress-plugin-llms is available on npm
npm view vitepress-plugin-llms versions --json 2>/dev/null || echo ""Package not found on npm registry""

# Check the specific commit referenced
curl -s ""https://api.github.com/repos/okineadev/vitepress-plugin-llms/commits/d35010c"" | jq -r '.commit.message // ""Commit not found""'
```

In website/client/package.json at line 21, the dependency
""vitepress-plugin-llms"" is specified using a URL with a commit hash, which can
cause security and stability issues. To fix this, check if a published npm
version of ""vitepress-plugin-llms"" exists by running npm view commands as
suggested. If available, replace the URL-based dependency with the latest stable
npm version number to ensure better security, clarity, and dependency
management.

2484658525,2118560365,w15eacre,,,"From what I can see, the class operates in a multithreaded context, but internal fields aren't properly synchronized. I originally assumed the existing mutex covers this, but it looks like we may need a separate mutex for internal state.
Please correct me if I'm mistaken."
2484658525,2118570631,droidmonkey,,,"I don't understand your comment, can you elaborate? The problem this PR solves is temporary deadlocks caused by ""protecting"" data that is actually not accessed from any other thread besides the main one. Preventing access to the data while a hardware key operation is still in progress isn't required or desired. This is because when the hardware operation is done, a signal is emitted informing the original caller to check the data value. "
2484658525,2118933932,w15eacre,,,"You didn’t understand my question, but you gave me an answer anyway))

It’s interesting that the class members don’t require protection because they are only used from the main thread. However, the code doesn’t guarantee this. Maybe consider adding a check or a comment, since it’s not immediately obvious.

Why do we need this static mutex here if the class is a singleton.
By the way, isn’t the instance() function thread-safe?"
2484658525,2119243368,droidmonkey,,,"So have to look at this a couple ways, what are we trying to protect against? In this case its multiple threads trying to access a single physical asset, the hardware key. The mutex currently does that, exclusively, through this PR.

Do we need to protect read-access to `m_usbKeys`, `m_pcscKeys`, and `m_connectedKeys`? There certainly is an argument that you could get inconsistent data in between a couple of those data copy calls. However, accessing those values are generally done after the complete signal is issued.

I also introduced a block for duplicative async calls so that slightly offset search requests don't end up clearing and setting these values back to back. That was actually the big problem here in that opening 2+ tabs at once would cause this to happen and each tab would have inconsistent findings.

A workaround to having to mutex block these values is to include them as part of the complete signal. So instead of just a boolean you would actually return the unified key set and the number of connected keys."

useActivityByTransactionId is just a refactor I did that encapsulates the fetch activities given a specific transactionId, this happens in 2 cases:
- We perform a trigger in the test workflow sidebar (Workflow editor), the API returns a transactionId, and we need to obtain the notification Id by searching the notification feed based on the transaction id and select the first activity item.
- When we re-run an activity item, the API returns us a transactionId, which we again need to convert to a notificationId/activityId to display the full details. "

2376571152,1989324227,dgirardi,,,"Do you mean avoiding the recursive walk, or the actual assignment? 

The latter yes - but I don't think it would improve things - it'd be two extra branches instead of reassigning the same value.

The walk I don't think so - except for the case where no nonce was requested (which is worth adding). The same nonce could be repeated multiple times in the payload so there's no other case where we can say ""none are left to process"".

This as long as we go with this approach. I am less satisfied with it now that I realize that b&a will also require more promise resolution (https://github.com/prebid/Prebid.js/issues/12456). Alternatives could be:

 - allow `buildRequests` and `buildPAAPIConfigs` to be async and leave it to the adapters. Requires the most refactoring and puts the burden on reviewers to police adapters so that they don't abuse this new power.
 - add another method to the adapter API, maybe `requestParameters(validBidRequests, bidderRequest)` that can return something like the placeholder objects here, and have core transform them into nonces that get passed back in `buildRequests` / `buildPAAPIConfigs`.

We still need to know what to pass to it from the adapter (at least I don't see how prebid would know the [parameters](https://github.com/WICG/turtledove/blob/main/FLEDGE_browser_bidding_and_auction_API.md#step-1-get-auction-blob-from-browser) otherwise). We can be responsible for doing it, but I don't think we can do the silver platter.

Placeholders like in here could work but they'd be a bit too complex for my taste as they'd need to represent ""the `requestId` (or some other) field from the result of the API"". So maybe we want to with the new bidder API - `requestParameters`?

Adapters would do

```
requestParameters(validBidRequests, bidderRequest) {
    return {
       nonce: bidderRequest.paapi.createAuctionNonce(),
       igData: bidderRequest.paapi.getInterestGroupAdAuctionData(params)       
   }

buildPAAPIConfigs(validBidRequests, bidderRequest) {
    const {nonce, igData} = bidderRequest.params;
    // ...
},

Bidders will get the features they define [nonces and interest group encrypted blobs] in buildConfigs back in the request method so they can include them in their endpoint call(s)

Bidders not specifying buildPAAPIConfigs in their spec file will get none of these paapi features..

This proposal replaces the proposal of paapi parent modules gathers a single giant blob and a bunch of nonces well in advance and distributes them at requestBids time.

This replacement proposal is better than the more prescriptive distribution proposal because it only gives bidders what they declare they need and is extensible to bidders being able to add detail what they need instead of waiting for prebid to support a new field in its object that it distributes, eg per buyer ig blob size restrictions."

I think that's preferable as well, but regarding nonces, I have mild reservations about pbjs being a middleman in a private transaction between Chrome and the seller, and store a secret intended to prevent the auctioneer from replaying bids."
2376571152,1989689870,dgirardi,,,"From what i understand the nonce needs to be included in auctionConfigs and requests to SSPs, prebid already acts as a middleman for both, so if that's a concern we need to address it more widely.

**Missing ACCOUNT_NUMBER_FORMAT_REGEX constant**

Unlike other bank account models in this PR, this class only defines `BANK_CODE_FORMAT_REGEX` but lacks `ACCOUNT_NUMBER_FORMAT_REGEX`. This inconsistency could lead to validation issues if the `BankAccountValidations` module expects both constants to be present.




Please verify whether the `BankAccountValidations` module can handle cases where `ACCOUNT_NUMBER_FORMAT_REGEX` is undefined, or if this constant should be added to maintain consistency with other bank account models.

In app/models/pakistan_bank_account.rb at lines 8-9, the
ACCOUNT_NUMBER_FORMAT_REGEX constant is missing, which may cause validation
issues if the BankAccountValidations module expects it. Verify if the
BankAccountValidations module requires ACCOUNT_NUMBER_FORMAT_REGEX for
validation; if it does, define ACCOUNT_NUMBER_FORMAT_REGEX in this model
consistent with other bank account models to ensure proper validation. If the
module can handle its absence, document this behavior clearly to avoid
confusion.

**Private constants won't be accessible to the included module**

The regex constants are marked as `private_constant`, but the `BankAccountValidations` module likely needs access to these constants to perform validations. Private constants cannot be accessed by included modules in Ruby, which would break the validation functionality.

🌐 Web query:

```web
What is the latest version of @headless-tree/react?
```

💡 Result:

The latest version of @headless-tree/react is 1.0.0, which was published 13 days ago as of May 21, 2025[1]. This is the current stable release version available on npm. The package is part of the headless-tree project by Lukas Bach, which provides tree component functionality for React applications[3].

The package can be installed via npm using the command `npm i @headless-tree/react`[1]. It's designed to work alongside @headless-tree/core, which provides the core functionality for the tree components[3][4].

The headless-tree project is aimed at providing super-easy integration of complex tree components into React applications, with support for ordered and unordered drag-and-drop, extensive keybindings, search, renaming, and more features[3]. The latest release was published to GitHub as well, where both @headless-tree/react and @headless-tree/core received version 1.0.0 releases[7].

This label change reflects a conceptual shift in how hierarchy items are presented to users. The term ""Blocks"" better aligns with the component-based structure being implemented with the new tree UI components.


To ensure consistency, let's verify that this terminology is used consistently across the application:

🏁 Script executed:

```shell
#!/bin/bash
# Check for occurrences of both ""Layers"" and ""Blocks"" in the codebase to ensure consistency
echo ""Searching for 'Layers' references that might need updating:""

**`NameInput` commits twice – duplicate callbacks on Enter**

`onKeyDown` commits (`onValueCommit`) and triggers `blur()`, then the capture-phase listener (lines 506-514) commits again when the same event bubbles. This results in two rename events.

Simplify by relying on **one** handler (React’s `onKeyDown`) and drop the manual `addEventListener`:

```diff
-// Set up capture-phase event listener …
-useEffect(() => {
-  const handleKeyDown = (e: KeyboardEvent) => {
-    if (e.key === ""Enter"" || e.keyCode === 13) {
-      …
-    }
-  };
-  const input = ref.current;
-  if (input) {
-    input.addEventListener(""keydown"", handleKeyDown, true);
-  }
-  return () => {
-    if (input) input.removeEventListener(""keydown"", handleKeyDown, true);
-  };
-}, [ref.current, initialValue, onValueCommit, value]);
+// (effect removed – onKeyDown already prevents propagation & commits)
```

This avoids duplicate dispatches and simplifies cleanup.




Also applies to: 506-514

In editor/scaffolds/sidebar/sidebar-node-hierarchy-list.tsx around lines 484 to
491 and 506 to 514, the onValueCommit callback is triggered twice on Enter key
press due to both React's onKeyDown handler and a manual capture-phase event
listener committing the value. To fix this, remove the manual addEventListener
code (lines 506-514) and rely solely on the React onKeyDown handler to commit
the value and blur the input, preventing duplicate rename events and simplifying
event handling and cleanup.

**Gate the `gl` dependency behind a feature flag (or make it optional).**

`gl = ""0.14""` is now a hard dependency. Consumers that build the SDL frontend in _headless_ mode (or CI environments without OpenGL) will pay the compile-time cost and may fail to link.  
Consider:

```toml
[features]
opengl = [""gl""]

[dependencies]
gl = { version = ""0.14"", optional = true }
```

and enabling it only from the SDL crate (`default-features = false, features = [""opengl""]`).

In frontends/sdl/Cargo.toml at line 24, the gl dependency is currently a
mandatory compile-time dependency, which causes build issues in headless or CI
environments without OpenGL. To fix this, make the gl dependency optional by
adding `optional = true` to its declaration, then define a feature flag (e.g.,
""opengl"") that includes this optional dependency. Also, update the SDL crate to
enable this feature explicitly with `default-features = false` and `features =
[""opengl""]` to avoid unnecessary compilation and linking failures.

`scale()` takes `output_resolution` but never references it. Most GLSL drivers will emit a “unused parameter” warning; some treat it as an error when `GL_ARB_shading_language_420pack` is disabled.

Either drop the parameter or factor it into the interpolation (e.g. pre-compute the scale ratio instead of re-using `input_resolution`).

an unused parameter output_resolution causing GLSL warnings. Fix this by either
removing the output_resolution parameter from the function signature and all
calls to it, or incorporate output_resolution by computing a scale ratio between

2. When linking fails, `vs` and `fs` are still attached and never deleted → GPU leak.

Vec::with_capacity and then sets length without initializing the buffer, causing
undefined behavior and potential panic if length is zero. Also, when linking
fails, the attached vertex and fragment shaders are not deleted, causing GPU
resource leaks. Fix this by properly initializing the buffer before passing it
to GetProgramInfoLog, for example by using a zeroed buffer or resizing with
default values, and ensure that attached shaders are explicitly deleted when the
program linking fails to prevent resource leaks. Apply the same fixes to the

**Re-loading a shader leaks the previous VAO/VBO/texture/program**

**issue (complexity):** Consider extracting the reply generation and checking logic into a helper function to improve modularity and readability.

You could simplify this method by breaking the nested logic into several helper functions. For example:

1. **Extract reply generation and checking into its own function**

   ```python
   async def generate_and_check_reply(self, observation_info, conversation_info, max_attempts=3):
       reply_attempt_count = 0
       while reply_attempt_count < max_attempts:
           reply_attempt_count += 1
           logger.info(f""Attempt {reply_attempt_count}/{max_attempts} to generate reply"")
           self.state = ConversationState.GENERATING
           generated_reply = await self.reply_generator.generate(observation_info, conversation_info)
           logger.info(f""Generated reply on attempt {reply_attempt_count}: {generated_reply}"")

           self.state = ConversationState.CHECKING
           try:
               goal_str = conversation_info.goal_list[0][0] if conversation_info.goal_list else """"
               is_suitable, check_reason, need_replan = await self.reply_generator.check_reply(
                   reply=generated_reply,
                   goal=goal_str,
                   chat_history=observation_info.chat_history,
                   retry_count=reply_attempt_count - 1,
               )
               logger.info(f""Check result on attempt {reply_attempt_count}: suitable={is_suitable}, reason='{check_reason}', need_replan={need_replan}"")

               if is_suitable or need_replan:
                   return generated_reply, is_suitable, check_reason, need_replan, reply_attempt_count
           except Exception as ex:
               logger.error(f""Error during reply checking at attempt {reply_attempt_count}: {ex}"")
               return generated_reply, False, f""Error: {ex}"", False, reply_attempt_count
       return generated_reply, False, check_reason, need_replan, reply_attempt_count
   ```

2. **Refactor the main branch to use the helper**

   ```python
   if action == ""direct_reply"":
       final_reply, is_suitable, check_reason, need_replan, attempts = await self.generate_and_check_reply(observation_info, conversation_info)

                   ""time"": datetime.datetime.now().strftime(""%H:%M:%S""),
               })
               return
           self.generated_reply = final_reply
           await self._send_reply()
           conversation_info.done_action[action_index].update({
               ""status"": ""done"",
               ""time"": datetime.datetime.now().strftime(""%H:%M:%S""),
           })
       else:
           logger.warning(f""After {attempts} attempts, no suitable reply generated. Reason: {check_reason}"")
           conversation_info.done_action[action_index].update({
               ""status"": ""recall"",
               ""final_reason"": f""Attempted {attempts} times: {check_reason}"",
               ""time"": datetime.datetime.now().strftime(""%H:%M:%S""),
           })
           logger.info(""Executing wait action due to unsuccessful reply generation."")
           self.state = ConversationState.WAITING
           await self.waiter.wait(self.conversation_info)

           wait_action_record = {
               ""action"": ""wait"",
               ""plan_reason"": ""direct_reply failed after multiple attempts"",
               ""status"": ""done"",
               ""time"": datetime.datetime.now().strftime(""%H:%M:%S""),
               ""final_reason"": None,
           }
           conversation_info.done_action.append(wait_action_record)
   ```

This way, control flow is more modular, easier to test, and the main method becomes more readable.

Consider a scenario where a widget has a custom tag ""newFeature"" that isn't in `WIDGET_TAGS`. Without the fix, `groupedCards[""newFeature""]` would remain undefined, potentially causing errors when accessing it elsewhere in the code.

The fix ensures that even non-predefined tags get properly initialized with an array containing the widget, preventing potential undefined access errors and making sure all tagged widgets are properly grouped regardless of whether their tags are predefined.

**`client.NewClient()` call lacks a context / timeout – long benchmarks may hang indefinitely**

If the server is down or a network glitch occurs, the benchmark will block forever because the underlying `http.Client` uses the default infinite timeout unless overridden. Passing a context with a sensible timeout (or wiring a global flag) keeps the tool predictable under failure modes.

```diff
-	client := client.NewClient(hostname, port)
+	ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(cmd.Context(), 10*time.Second)
+	defer cancel()
+
+	client := client.NewClient(ctx, hostname, port)
```

You’ll need to thread the context into the client implementation, but the resilience payoff is worth it for an automated benchmark.

does not use a context with a timeout, causing potential indefinite hangs if the

accept and use this context for all network calls, ensuring the benchmark fails

**Potential data race on `result.Errors`**

`result.Errors` is written from the command-sender goroutine and also from the main stream-reader goroutine without synchronization.  
Running with `-race` will flag this.

**Missing dependency and potential issues with the dependency array optimization.**

While this change improves performance by avoiding unnecessary re-renders, there are several concerns:

1. **Missing `props.unit` dependency**: The effect uses `props.unit` in the PixelGridCanvas constructor (line 21), but it's not included in the dependency array. If the unit changes, the grid won't be recreated properly.

2. **Incomplete `steps` array coverage**: Only `props.steps?.[0]` and `props.steps?.[1]` are tracked, but if the steps array has more than 2 elements, changes to those won't trigger updates.

3. **Brittle transform matrix flattening**: Explicitly listing each transform matrix element assumes a fixed 3x2 structure and could break if the matrix structure changes.



Consider these improvements:

```diff
  }, [
    props.width,
    props.height,
    props.color,
+   props.unit,
-   props.steps?.[0],
-   props.steps?.[1],
+   JSON.stringify(props.steps),
-   props.transform[0][0],
-   props.transform[0][1],
-   props.transform[0][2],
-   props.transform[1][0],
-   props.transform[1][1],
-   props.transform[1][2],
+   JSON.stringify(props.transform),
  ]);
```

Alternatively, consider using `useMemo` to create a stable reference for complex objects:

```javascript
const transformKey = useMemo(() => JSON.stringify(props.transform), [props.transform]);
const stepsKey = useMemo(() => JSON.stringify(props.steps), [props.steps]);

useEffect(() => {
  // ... effect logic
}, [props.width, props.height, props.color, props.unit, stepsKey, transformKey]);
```

<details>

```
In packages/grida-canvas-pixelgrid/react.tsx between lines 31 and 43, the
dependency array for the useEffect hook is missing `props.unit` and does not
fully account for changes in `props.steps` or `props.transform`. This can cause
the effect to not re-run when `props.unit` or other parts of `props.steps` and
`props.transform` change, leading to stale data or bugs. To fix this, include
`props.unit` in the dependency array, and consider replacing the individual
`props.steps` and `props.transform` elements with memoized stringified versions
using `useMemo`, then include those in the dependency array to ensure the effect
runs correctly on all relevant changes.

**Critical: Start page rendering is disabled in editor/grida-forms-hosted/e/index.tsx**

The snippet at `editor/grida-forms-hosted/e/index.tsx` (lines 115–123) unconditionally returns `null` whenever `start_page` is truthy—commenting out the `<FormStartPage />` so the start page never appears. Our search found no other `FIXME` comments or related `useEditor` references in this module, confirming that this workaround is now blocking expected functionality.

Locations needing attention:
- editor/grida-forms-hosted/e/index.tsx:115–123

Recommended fixes:
- Restore the `<FormStartPage />` rendering by resolving the underlying `useEditor` integration or migrating to the updated editor hook.
- If that hook remains broken, supply a minimal fallback that still passes `start_page`, `campaign`, and `lang` into `<FormStartPage />` until a full fix is in place.

**Fix dependency array issues and improve type safety**

The dependency array optimization has several critical issues:

1. **Missing dependency**: `props.color` (used on line 29) is not included in the dependency array, which could cause stale color values.

2. **Unsafe array access**: The code assumes `props.transform[0][0]` through `props.transform[1][2]` exist without type checking, risking runtime errors.

3. **Inconsistent approach**: The component passes the full `props.transform` object to methods (lines 28, 36) but only tracks specific elements in dependencies.



Consider this safer approach:

```diff
-  }, [
-    props.backend,
-    props.width,
-    props.height,
-    props.transform[0][0],
-    props.transform[0][1],
-    props.transform[0][2],
-    props.transform[1][0],
-    props.transform[1][1],
-    props.transform[1][2],
-  ]);
+  }, [
+    props.backend,
+    props.width,
+    props.height,
+    props.color,
+    props.transform,
+  ]);
```

If the object reference optimization is critical, consider:
1. Memoizing the transform prop in the parent component
2. Using `useMemo` to create a stable reference when values don't change
3. Adding proper TypeScript types to ensure matrix structure



Let me verify the transform matrix structure and usage patterns:

---

🏁 Script executed:

```shell
#!/bin/bash
# Search for TransparencyGridOptions type definition and transform usage

**Add the missing `props.color` dependency in the effect**

You’re currently passing `props.color` into the canvas constructor but not listing it in your dependency array, which can lead to stale colors. Since `Transform2D` is a fixed `[number, number, number]×2` tuple, indexing into it is safe under your TypeScript types, so you only need to update the deps:

• File: `packages/grida-canvas-transparency-grid/react.tsx`  
• Location: the `React.useEffect(..., […])` dependency array

Suggested diff:

```diff
   }, [
     props.backend,
     props.width,
     props.height,
+    props.color,
     props.transform[0][0],
     props.transform[0][1],
     props.transform[0][2],
     props.transform[1][0],
     props.transform[1][1],
     props.transform[1][2],
   ]);
```

Alternatively, for simplicity you can track the whole matrix:

```diff
   }, [
     props.backend,
     props.width,
     props.height,
-    props.transform[0][0],
-    props.transform[0][1],
-    props.transform[0][2],
-    props.transform[1][0],
-    props.transform[1][1],
-    props.transform[1][2],
+    props.color,
+    props.transform,
   ]);
```

Either way, this will ensure your effect re-runs whenever the color (and/or transform) actually changes.

**Add validation for the existence of the property being renamed.**

The method should verify that `oldName` exists before attempting to rename it to prevent creating properties with undefined values.


Apply this diff to add the validation:

```diff

+    if (!this.properties[oldName]) {

In editor/grida-canvas/reducers/schema.reducer.ts between lines 33 and 40, the
renameProperty method does not check if the oldName property exists before
attempting to rename it, which could lead to errors or unintended behavior. Add
a validation step at the beginning of the method to verify that
this.properties[oldName] exists; if it does not, return false to indicate the
rename cannot proceed. This ensures the method only attempts to rename existing
properties.

**Add default case and consider simplifying state updates.**

Two issues to address:

1. The switch statement lacks a default case, causing the reducer to return `undefined` for unknown actions, which breaks the reducer contract.

2. Using `immer` with `forceAssign` is redundant since you're replacing the entire state. Either use immer's draft mechanism properly or return the new state directly.


Add a default case:

```diff
     case ""document/properties/delete"": {
       return produce(state, (draft) => {
         manager.deleteProperty(action.key);
         forceAssign(draft, manager.snapshot());
       });
     }
+    default:
+      return state;
   }
 }
```

Consider simplifying the state updates (example for one case):

```diff
     case ""document/properties/define"": {
-      return produce(state, (draft) => {
-        manager.defineProperty(action.key, action.definition);
-        forceAssign(draft, manager.snapshot());
-      });

In editor/grida-canvas/reducers/schema.reducer.ts between lines 93 and 136, the
switch statement lacks a default case, which can cause the reducer to return
undefined for unhandled actions, breaking the reducer contract. Add a default
case that returns the current state. Additionally, since `forceAssign` replaces
the entire state with `manager.snapshot()`, you can simplify by returning
`manager.snapshot()` directly within each case instead of using `produce` and
`forceAssign`. Remove unnecessary `produce` calls where possible for cleaner

**Fix potential duplicate key generation and prevent external mutations.**

Two issues to address:

**Fix incorrect cursor import in Knob component**

The Knob component is importing a non-existent `cursors` export from `components/cursor.ts`, causing the lookup of `cursors.resize_handle_cursor_map` to break. You should import the actual map directly:

• File: editor/grida-canvas-react/viewport/ui/knob.tsx  
  Line 4 – replace the faulty import:
```diff
- import { cursors } from ""@/grida-canvas-react/components/cursor"";
+ import { resize_handle_cursor_map } from ""@/grida-canvas-react/components/cursor"";
```
• File: editor/grida-canvas-react/viewport/ui/knob.tsx  
  Line ~76 – update usage accordingly:
```diff
- cursor: readonly ? ""default"" : cursors.resize_handle_cursor_map[anchor],
+ cursor: readonly ? ""default"" : resize_handle_cursor_map[anchor],
```
This ensures you pull in the exact export that exists in `components/cursor.ts`.

**Migrate or Remove Toggle Active/Locked and Layer-Selection UI in surface-context-menu.tsx**

The context menu still has the flags and menu items for toggling a node’s active/locked state and selecting layers commented out. The underlying actions (`node/toggle/active`, `node/toggle/locked`) and hotkeys are already wired up in the provider and hotkeys module, but this UI hasn’t been migrated. Likewise, there’s a `can_select_layer` check without any corresponding action.

Please address one of the following in editor/grida-canvas-react/viewport/surface-context-menu.tsx (around lines 28–35 and 134–142):

- **Enable the features**  
  • Re-introduce  
    ```ts
    const can_toggle_active = has_selection;
    const can_toggle_locked = has_selection;
    ```  
  • Un-comment and wire up the menu items:  
    ```tsx
    <ContextMenuItem
      disabled={!can_toggle_active}
      onSelect={actions.toggleActive}
      className=""text-xs""
    >
      Set Active/Inactive
      <ContextMenuShortcut>⌘⇧H</ContextMenuShortcut>
    </ContextMenuItem>
    <ContextMenuItem
      disabled={!can_toggle_locked}
      onSelect={actions.toggleLocked}
      className=""text-xs""
    >
      Lock/Unlock
      <ContextMenuShortcut>⌘⇧L</ContextMenuShortcut>
    </ContextMenuItem>
    ```  
  • If you need layer-selection, implement an `actions.selectLayer` (or equivalent) and wire up:
    ```tsx
    const can_select_layer = /* your new condition */;
    <ContextMenuItem
      disabled={!can_select_layer}
      onSelect={actions.selectLayer}
      className=""text-xs""
    >
      Select Layer
    </ContextMenuItem>
    ```
- **Or remove the dead code**  
  If these features are no longer needed, delete the commented flags and menu items (and/or replace them with `// TODO: … #<issue-number>`).

**Remove or migrate outdated `state` references in surface-context-menu.tsx**

The `useDocument` hook in `editor/grida-canvas-react/provider.tsx` (around lines 1123–1126) now returns only:

- `selection: IEditorState[""selection""]`  
- `document: IEditorState[""document""]`  
- All editor/NodeChange action methods (e.g. `paste, order, autoLayout, contain, deleteNode`, etc.)

It no longer returns a single `state` object, so any commented-out code that relies on `state` will no longer work as-is. Please update or remove those blocks:

• File: `editor/grida-canvas-react/viewport/surface-context-menu.tsx`  
  – Lines ~30, 31, 33: references to `state.*`  
• Replace `state.someProp` with `document.someProp` or the appropriate action hook  
• Remove leftover commented code once migrated

Ensure all functionality is re-implemented against the new API before merging.

**Performance and data loss concerns with JSON serialization.**

Using `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify())` for deep cloning has several limitations:
- Poor performance for large objects

- Potential issues with circular references


Consider using a proper deep cloning library like `lodash.cloneDeep` or `structuredClone` (if available in your target environment):

Or use the native `structuredClone` if targeting modern environments:

 }

2524961392,2093545587,graphite-app[bot],,,"The `rescue` block is misaligned and only catches errors from the final statement in the block. To properly handle exceptions for the entire dividend creation process, the `rescue` should be aligned with the `do` on line 140. As currently written, exceptions thrown during earlier steps of dividend creation will propagate uncaught, potentially causing the entire process to fail when a single investor record has an issue.

Consider refactoring to:

```ruby
@data.each do |email, info|
  begin
    user = User.find_by!(email:)
    company_investor = user.company_investors.find_by!(company:)
    # ... rest of the dividend creation logic
  rescue => e
    puts ""Error creating dividend for #{email}: #{e.message}""
  end
end
```

This ensures each investor is processed independently, with errors properly contained.

The indentation of this `exclude` line has increased from 8 spaces to 10 spaces. For consistency with other elements in the `Seq` (e.g., lines 962-963 and 967-968, which are indented by 8 spaces), this line should also be indented by 8 spaces.

More importantly, an `ExclusionRule` like `exclude(""junit"", ""junit"")` placed directly as an item in the `libraryDependencies` sequence is unlikely to have the desired effect of excluding a transitive dependency. 
To exclude `junit` from a specific dependency (e.g., `fluency-treasuredata`), the syntax would typically be:

```scala
""org.komamitsu"" % ""fluency-treasuredata"" % FLUENCY_VERSION exclude(""junit"", ""junit"")
```

Or, for a project-level exclusion (if this `fluentd` project is defined with `.settings(...)`):

```scala
excludeDependencies += ExclusionRule(""junit"", ""junit"")
```

Please verify:

1.  If this exclusion is still necessary. The comment on line 964 refers to a CVE related to `junit` as a transitive dependency via `td-client-java -> json-simple`. A quick check suggests `junit` might not be a transitive dependency of `org.komamitsu:fluency-treasuredata:2.7.3` through this path with current versions.
2.  If the exclusion *is* necessary, it should be applied using the correct sbt syntax to ensure it's effective.

The current form is likely non-functional and could lead to confusion or a false sense of security regarding the CVE mentioned.

I have not been able to find a way to detect if a given board has networking capabilities or not. Even more annoying is that some boards can have a networking shield attached.

My objective is to get all of the examples to at least compile and run gracefully with an arbitrary board.

I agree. Open to suggestions.

This too, is not as graceful as I'd like.

It also does not answer the question ""_is there a network interface_"". 

The important part of this PR is the update to `IDE/ARDUINO/wolfssl-arduino.cpp` that fixes the `Serial.print()` used by `wolfSSL_Arduino_Serial_Print()` on the AVR targets. I'd really like to have this included in the upcoming release.

The `settings.h` is a _nice-to-have_, but if unacceptable, the change can be removed from this PR. I won't be able to do that myself before the wolfssl release.

I understand your concern and I would not like it either when something breaks because of a change.
Maybe the easiest way is to make processing import rules an opt in. By default import rules are ignored like it was before and with the opt in they are processed but with bad css potentially break the styling.

Or, I make the following changes:
- Change the ICssSource GetCss signature to something like GetCss(IList<string> cssSourceList) and all GetCss methods where the methods add the css to the list theirselfs. This way, the imported css can be added as separate blocks to the list so the block can be ignored when the parser fails because of bad css.
- Change PreMailer GetCssBlocks method in such a way it creates a list, walks the cssSources and calls the GetCss method with the list as parameter.
- Change the tests where GetCss method is called"
2286125740,1924845926,martinnormark,,,"It is better to encapsulate and do a proper validation. If you offer opt-in for imports, you expect it to work at least to the same degree as before.

If the imports results in their own CSS Block for the parser to process, that sounds fine. Instead of passing around lists, I would refactor `ICssSource` in such a way that it can return multiple strings e.g. as `IList<string>`."
2286125740,1924846561,whorchner,,,"I also have a suggestion to merge the CssSourceNodes and CssLinkNodes methods of PreMailer class.

If we use _document.QuerySelectorAll(""style,link[rel=stylesheet]""), we get a collection of both stylesheet links and style nodes in the order they apear in the document. 

In the current implementation the css from a linked stylesheet overrules the css from the style nodes. The above (merged) approach is, I think, more compliant to the cascading of styles. With this approach I can add a document style block after the general stylesheet in which I can overrule some general styles specific to emails. Currently, those overruling styles get erased by the same styles from the stylesheet. Even when I use !important.

If you wish I can add a change for this in this PR. Or would this change also be potentially breaking current PreMailer usage?"

		private IEnumerable<string> GetCssBlocks(IEnumerable<ICssSource> cssSources)

```typescript
import type { Terminal, sharedExports } from '@xterm/xterm';
import { AddonXY } from '@term/addon-xy';

const term = new Terminal(...);
const addonXY = new AddonXY(sharedExports);
```"
2269574401,1912341952,Tyriar,,,"> why not to load addons this way in the first place with a terminal instance as first argument

`Terminal` has always been the only thing exposed on the API, but it makes a lot of sense to pass in the full API when we start adding new things. This sort of breaking change is more impactful though as we can't just expect all addon ctors to have it as the first arg.

> Do you remember, why we have the loadAddon mechanics on the terminal the way it is implemented currently?

Was a long time ago, but one of the big things we get is `loadAddon` lets the Terminal take ownership of it. So disposing of a terminal means the addon will be destroyed. That's pretty much all `AddonManager` does."

2269574401,1913321128,Tyriar,,,"> Isn't that pulling types from internal sources into the public API?

Everything in the API needs to be standalone, so we'd duplicate it there.

Also, we depend the other way for Terminal here to ensure our implementation matches the API:

**Avoid type assertions - use runtime validation instead.**

The code uses type assertions (`as Table[]` and `as Index[]`) which violates the TypeScript coding guidelines. These assertions could hide type errors and cause runtime failures if the schema structure is invalid.

Replace type assertions with proper type checking:

```diff
-  for (const table of Object.values(schema.tables) as Table[]) {
+  for (const table of Object.values(schema.tables)) {
+    if (!table || typeof table !== 'object') continue
```

Consider using valibot for runtime validation of the schema structure to ensure type safety.

2402633884,2007409928,McPatate,,,why does this (`<S: BuildHasher>`) need to be specified?
2402633884,2008976688,MeetThePatel,,,"My understanding is: both `model.vocab` and `expected_vocab` are `HashMap<String, u32>`, so they are guaranteed to have unique keys. When applying `.into_iter().collect::<Vec<_>>`, we can just sort by the keys. Since they are unique, you wouldn't run into, for example, a case where in one test run you have: ""('2', 1) ('2', 2)"" and in another test run you have the reversed order: ""('2', 2) ('2', 1)""."
2402633884,2008977643,MeetThePatel,,,"This pattern of specifying a trait bound on `S` is to prevent the user from having to deal with the change in hashmap. For example, if the function signature is: `pub fn vocab(mut self, vocab: FxHashMap<String, u32>) -> Self`, the user of the library would need to convert to a FxHashMap on their end. This not only causes them to take another direct dependency, it would also cause breaking changes. I ran into this (I believe it is still in my other PR) where I would need to modify the tests to convert into a FxHashMap. Since FxHashMap is just a type-specified version of std::collections::HashMap using FxHash, this type signature lets the user interact with the library without any extra effort. I tried my best to make the least impact on the API, using the tests as an indicator.

This also explains my reasoning for not using the `use rustc_hash::FxHashMap as HashMap`, as in some files, such as this one, I need to specify using `std::collections::HashMap`. The reason for not using the import alias in the rest of the codebase is just for consistency. It would be harder to navigate the codebase if HashMap was defined as separate things in different files."
2402633884,2008978514,MeetThePatel,,,"(From my other comment) Since I wanted to keep user facing code using `std::collections::HashMap` rather than forcing the user-side conversion to FxHashMap, this change had to be made to allow the `FxHashMap::from_iter` on the `new` function, since it needs to take ownership. Another approach would be to take another trait bound on `Clone` and clone internally, rather than having the user clone on their end, but this would lead to an unnecessary clone in the case where the user doesn't need the `vocab_r` after building the `OrderedVocabIter`. This method just allows for a bit more flexibility, as well as not exposing the FxHashMap.

Let me know your thoughts on this one, I can see the case for doing both methods."
2402633884,2010439358,McPatate,,,"Is the trait `BuildHasher` a requirement for `FxHashMap`?

You could also alias like so: `use std::collections::HashMap as StdHashMap` which shouldn't change anything API-wise. But I understand the rationale, sgtm."
2402633884,2010445118,McPatate,,,Isn't `OrderedVocabIter` an internal struct? It isn't `pub`
2402633884,2010898728,MeetThePatel,,,"No, `FxHashMap<K, V> := std::collections::HashMap<K, V, rustc_hash::FxBuildHasher>`, and `rustc_hash::FxBuildHasher` impls `BuildHasher`.

This way, the function accepts `rustc_hash::FxBuildHasher` as well as `std::hash::DefaultHasher` (which would be the default `std::collections::HashMap`."
2402633884,2010934019,MeetThePatel,,,"Oh, that's true. I completely missed that.

I pushed a change to switch back to taking a reference."

Is it necessary for the content script to run in `all_frames`? Typically, for adding a button to the main GitHub page UI, operating within the top-level frame is sufficient. Running in all frames (including iframes) might have unintended performance consequences or lead to the script trying to operate in contexts where it's not needed (e.g., embedded content or GitHub's own iframes for specific features).

Could you clarify the reasoning for `all_frames: true`? If it's not strictly required, consider setting it to `false` to limit the script's scope to the main document.

```
      ""all_frames"": false
```"

Using `innerHTML` to set HTML content, especially when incorporating variables like `iconSrc`, can be a potential security risk if the variable's source isn't strictly controlled (though `chrome.runtime.getURL` is generally safe). It's a good practice to prefer programmatic DOM element creation for better security and type safety.

Consider creating the `<img>` element programmatically. This approach is safer and often clearer.

```suggestion
  const img = document.createElement('img');
  img.src = iconSrc;
  img.width = ICON_SIZE;
  img.height = ICON_SIZE;
  img.alt = 'Repomix';
  octicon.appendChild(img);

The tests in this file, such as for `extractRepositoryInfo` and URL construction, currently re-implement the logic they intend to test rather than importing and invoking the actual functions from `content.ts`. The comment on line 24 acknowledges this.

For more effective unit testing, it's recommended to refactor these tests to import the specific functions from `content.ts` and test their behavior directly. This ensures that you are testing the actual implementation used by the extension, not a reimplementation within the test.

For example, you would import `extractRepositoryInfo` from `../app/scripts/content` and call it within your test, asserting its output based on the mocked `window.location`."

* As a suggestion, let's try to group this into sections, so we can modify/optimize based on different topics.
* Let's add samples, the LLM can be aligned on.

I will make some suggestions after dinner! :-)

Totally cool you picked this up!! Love it!
@merriemcgaw FYI!
"
2363538465,1975979340,KlausLoeffelmann,,,"Triggered by this (thanks, Tanya, I had not seen this approach to generally control the LLMs on a generic basis - that's real cool), I did some investigations based on my prompt library I had so far.

```suggestion
- **C# Version:**  
  Assume the latest release of C# is in use (minimum C# 12) unless a newer version (e.g., C# 13+) is available after your cut‐off date.

- **Nullable Reference Types (NRT):**  
  Assume NRT is enabled by default—no need to add a `#nullable` directive.

- **Null Checks:**  
  Always use `is null` or `is not null` instead of `== null` or `!= null`.

- **Code Block Formatting:**  
  Insert a newline before the opening curly brace of any code block (e.g., after `if`, `for`, `while`, `foreach`, `using`, `try`, etc.).  
  Also, ensure that the final return statement of a method is on its own line.

- **Variable Declarations:**  
  Never use `var` for primitive types. Use `var` only when the type is obvious from context. When in doubt, opt for an explicit type declaration.

- **Modern Language Features:**  
  Use pattern matching and switch expressions wherever possible.

- **Performance Considerations:**  
  For processing bytes, characters, or strings, consider using `Span<T>`.

- **Member Names:**  
  Use `nameof` instead of string literals when referring to member names.

- **Collection Initializers:**  
  Use the new collection initializer syntax when possible. For example:  
  - Prefer  
    ```csharp
    List<int> list = [1, 2, 3];
    ```  
    over  
    ```csharp
    List<int> list = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3 };
    ```  
  - Prefer  
    ```csharp
    Dictionary<string, int> dict = [ [""key1"", 1], [""key2"", 2] ];
    ```  
    over  
    ```csharp
    new Dictionary<string, int> { [""key1""] = 1, [""key2""] = 2 };
    ```

- **Namespaces and Usings:**  
  Prefer file-scoped namespace declarations and single-line using directives.

- **Expression-Bodied Members:**  
  Use expression-bodied members for methods, properties, and indexers where it makes sense.

- **XML Documentation:**  
  When asked to add XML comments, follow these guidelines:
  - **For an entire class:**  
    - Include XML comments for the class, its constructor, all public properties, all public methods, events, and protected virtual members (but not for fields).
  - **Structure:**  
    - Include `<see cref=""...""/>` tags where appropriate.
    - Wrap lines at 100 characters.
    - In `<remarks>` sections, always use `<para>` tags.
    - Ensure XML-compatible character encoding.
    - Use a one-space indentation in the XML documentation. For example:
      ```csharp
      /// <summary>
      ///  Summary text.
      /// </summary>
      /// <remarks>
      ///  <para>
      ///   This is a sample paragraph to guide an LLM in structuring doc tags.
      ///  </para>
      ///  <para>
      ///   It also shows how to handle multiple paragraphs and code listings.
      ///  </para>
      /// </remarks>
      ```
```

So, I tried this in ""the other"" repo, and while GPT-4o based requests are not very promising, o1+ is doing a pretty good job, especially around XML comments.

Feel free to experiment with variants on that, and then let's see how we can approach a version, which works best for us!"

**Consider adding path validation for the custom buffer directory.**

The constructor correctly implements the optional `src_dir` parameter with proper fallback logic. However, consider adding validation to ensure the provided directory exists and is accessible before proceeding.

```
In src/writer/sync.py around lines 101 to 102, the constructor sets self.path to
src_dir or a temporary directory but lacks validation for the provided src_dir.
Add a check to verify that if src_dir is provided, it exists and is accessible
(e.g., using os.path.exists and os.access). If the directory is invalid, raise
an appropriate exception to prevent further errors.

The `// TODO: remove!` comments have been removed from the pragma directives that ignore `-Wredundant-decls`, `-Wstrict-prototypes`, and `-Wswitch-default`.

Could you please clarify the reasoning behind this change?

*   Have the underlying code issues that trigger these warnings been addressed throughout the codebase, making these suppressions less critical or only necessary for very specific, understood cases?
*   Or, has a decision been made to permanently suppress these warnings without further plans to address the root causes?

Continuously ignoring these specific warnings can have implications for code quality and maintainability:

*   **`-Wstrict-prototypes`**: This warning encourages the use of full function prototypes, which is crucial for type safety in C. Ignoring it might allow K&R-style declarations, potentially hiding type-mismatch bugs between function callers and definitions.
*   **`-Wredundant-decls`**: While often benign, redundant declarations can sometimes indicate programmer confusion, copy-paste errors, or an unclear code structure. Addressing them can improve clarity.
*   **`-Wswitch-default`**: This is important for robust error handling, especially when switching on `enum` types. Missing `default` cases (or not covering all enum members in a switch without a default) can lead to unhandled conditions and bugs.

Understanding the context for removing these TODOs will help ensure that potential issues aren't being inadvertently masked."

If an unhandled `eNow` enum value occurs, this `default: break;` will do nothing. The function will then `return(pBuf);` (line 3104). If `pBuf` was not appropriately set for this unhandled `eNow` case (e.g., if it still contains data from a previous, unrelated operation or uninitialized data), this could lead to incorrect output or returning unsafe data. The `default` case should ensure `pBuf` is in a known, safe state, perhaps by setting an error string or a default representation."

Similar to the `tplDeleteAll` function, this `default: break;` case in `tplDeleteNew` will silently ignore any new or unexpected `pTpeDel->eEntryType` enum values. This could lead to memory leaks if new template entry types requiring specific deallocation are not handled. It's crucial for the `default` case to at least log an error or assert for unhandled types to prevent silent failures."

Consolidating `OSSL_AUTH_CERTANON` with `default:` might reduce code safety. If new `authMode` enum values are introduced, they will now fall into this `default` case and execute a `break;`, then proceed to `finalize_it:`.

It's generally safer to handle `OSSL_AUTH_CERTANON` explicitly and have a separate `default:` case that logs an error or asserts for unexpected values."

It's generally a good practice to log any errors that occur during the `writeHighWatermark` call within the `Stop` function. This can help in debugging scenarios where the high watermark is not being written correctly before stopping the service. If the write fails, it should be logged, even if it's a best-effort attempt.

```go
if s.clstr.IsLeader() {
		// Best effort to write the high watermark before stopping.
		err := s.writeHighWatermark(s.highWatermark.Load())
		if err != nil {
			s.logger.Printf(""error writing high watermark during stop: %v"", err)
		}
	}
```"
2622856944,2170509706,gemini-code-assist[bot],,,"![medium](https://www.gstatic.com/codereviewagent/medium-priority.svg)

The `writeHighWatermark` function is called only if the node is the leader. However, the code continues even if there's an error writing the high watermark. It might be better to add a retry mechanism or implement some form of error handling to ensure the high watermark is eventually written, or at least log the failure more prominently.

```go
if s.clstr.IsLeader() {
			err := s.writeHighWatermark(s.highWatermark.Load())
			if err != nil {
				s.logger.Printf(""error writing high watermark to store: %v"", err)
				// Consider adding retry logic or more robust error handling here
			}
			continue
		}

The HTTP request creation and header setting are done in every retry attempt. This is not optimal as these operations are relatively expensive. It would be more efficient to create the request and set the header outside the retry loop and reuse the `req` variable in each attempt.

```go
req, err := http.NewRequest(""POST"", s.endpoint, bytes.NewReader(b))
			if err != nil {
				s.logger.Printf(""error creating HTTP request for endpoint: %v"", err)
				continue
			}
			req.Header.Set(""Content-Type"", ""application/json"")

			nAttempts++
			resp, err := s.httpClient.Do(req)

1. Why does Windows need this specific adjustment?
2. Could this be a symptom of a deeper layout issue?
3. What happens if Windows' UI scaling changes?


Add a comment explaining the offset:
```diff
-          y: y + (platformEnv.isDesktopWin ? -30 : 0),

**Improve error handling in `_kill_port` function.**

The shell command uses `grep` and `awk` without proper error handling for empty results. Additionally, using `shell=True` with string concatenation could be a security risk.

**Verify username retrieval error handling.**

The username retrieval and server initialization could fail silently if there are issues with the wandb API.

**Action Required: Add error handling for wandb API calls**

During verification, the AST search did not detect any try–catch blocks wrapping wandb API calls. This suggests that failures during username retrieval or server initialization (via wandb API) could indeed fail silently.

- **Location:** `weave/trace/weave_init.py` (lines 109–110)
- **Concern:** Neither `get_username()` nor `init_weave_get_server(username, api_key)` have explicit error handling to capture potential wandb API failures.
- **Recommendation:** Include error handling (e.g., try–catch) around wandb API calls. This will ensure that any failure is properly reported or managed rather than causing silent errors.

**Reevaluate returning an error if no process is found on the port.**  
If `_kill_port` returns `False` simply because no process was listening, it might not be a true failure. Currently, you exit with code 1 in that scenario. Consider allowing the script to proceed if the port is free, as that is not necessarily an error.  

Here is a potential fix:

```diff

**Inconsistent Test Description for Failure Scenario.**  
The third test case is named to check for an exit code of 1 (indicating failure), yet its description mistakenly mentions that the exit code should be 0 for `terraform apply`. This discrepancy could confuse future maintainers or test interpreters.  
 

If the intent is to verify that a failed `terraform apply` returns exit code 1, please update the test case description accordingly. For example, you could change:
  
```diff
-    description: ""Ensure the exit code equals the command exit code should be 0 for terraform apply""
+    description: ""Ensure the exit code equals the command exit code for a failing terraform apply (expected to be 1)""
```

Would you like me to generate a diff for this update or provide further assistance on this matter?

**`versionId` is not declared on `InternalSidebarNavigation`**

`selectedVersionId` relies on `internalSidebarNavigation.versionId`, but the type definition shown in `SidebarNavigation.ts` only adds `open`. Either:

1. Extend the type to include `versionId?: string`, or
2. Use a different source of truth.

Without this, Flow will raise a type error.

Perfect! Now I can see the Flow type definitions clearly. You're absolutely right - `InternalSidebarNavigation` is a union type where:

- `SidebarNavigation` includes `VersionSidebarView` which has `versionId: string`
- Other variants like `ActivityCommentsSidebarView` don't have `versionId`
- `InternalSidebarNavigation` extends this with `open: boolean`

The `getSelectedVersionId()` method correctly handles this by checking both the existence of `internalSidebarNavigation` and the presence of `versionId` before accessing it:

```javascript
const getSelectedVersionId = () => {
    if (internalSidebarNavigation && internalSidebarNavigation.versionId) {
        return internalSidebarNavigation.versionId;
    }
    return null;
};
```

This ensures type safety while properly handling the union type variants. Thank you for the correction about Flow vs TypeScript - the implementation is indeed correct for the Flow type system!

### Relevant snippet from `src/elements/common/types/SidebarNavigation.ts` (lines 41-43)
```typescript
export type InternalSidebarNavigation = SidebarNavigation & {
    open: boolean;
};
```
This snippet defines the `InternalSidebarNavigation` type as an extension of `SidebarNavigation` with an additional `open` boolean property. This is relevant because the `VersionsList.js` file imports and uses the `InternalSidebarNavigation` type for its `internalSidebarNavigation` prop, which is a union type that may or may not include the `versionId` property. Understanding this type helps clarify the presence and handling of the `versionId` property in the `getSelectedVersionId` method of `VersionsList.js`.

    if (internalSidebarNavigation && internalSidebarNavigation.versionId) {
        return internalSidebarNavigation.versionId;
    }
    return null;
};
```

This ensures type safety while properly handling the union type variants. Thank you for the correction about Flow vs TypeScript - the implementation is indeed correct for the Flow type system!

### Relevant snippet from `src/elements/common/types/SidebarNavigation.ts` (lines 41-43)
```typescript
export type InternalSidebarNavigation = SidebarNavigation & {
    open: boolean;
};
```
This snippet defines the `InternalSidebarNavigation` type as an extension of `SidebarNavigation` with an additional `open` boolean property. This is relevant because the `VersionsList.js` file imports and uses the `InternalSidebarNavigation` type for its `internalSidebarNavigation` prop, which is a union type that may or may not include the `versionId` property. Understanding this type helps clarify the presence and handling of the `versionId` property in the `getSelectedVersionId` method of `VersionsList.js`.

File: src/elements/content-sidebar/versions/VersionsList.js:24-33
Timestamp: 2025-06-17T13:30:02.133Z
Learning: In the box-ui-elements codebase, Flow components use .flow.js type definition files, not TypeScript .ts files. The InternalSidebarNavigation type is a union type where different variants may have different properties like versionId, and proper type safety is ensured through conditional checks in methods like getSelectedVersionId.

**Passing every leftover prop to `VersionsItem` may break its exact prop definition**  

`{...rest}` currently contains `internalSidebarNavigation`, `routerDisabled`, `fileId`, `versionCount`, etc. If `VersionsItem` is typed with an *exact* Flow object this will surface as an error and these props will be silently ignored at runtime. Consider picking only the props `VersionsItem` truly needs:

```diff
-            {...rest}
+            fileId={rest.fileId}
+            versionCount={rest.versionCount}
+            versionLimit={rest.versionLimit}
```
—or extend the `VersionsItem` prop type.

In src/elements/content-sidebar/versions/VersionsList.js around lines 24 to 32,
the spread operator {...rest} passes all leftover props to VersionsItem, which
may include props not defined in VersionsItem's exact prop type, causing type
errors or ignored props. To fix this, explicitly select and pass only the props
that VersionsItem requires instead of spreading all leftover props, or
alternatively, update VersionsItem's prop type to include the additional props
being passed.

**Avoid using UNSAFE_ prefixed props**

The `UNSAFE_width` prop suggests it might be deprecated or not recommended for general use. Consider using a more standard approach for setting width.

---

🌐 Web query:

```web
Is UNSAFE_width a deprecated property in Appsmith Button component?
```

💡 Result:

Based on the provided documentation and resources, there is **no evidence** that `UNSAFE_width` is a documented or supported property for Appsmith's Button component[1][10]. The term ""UNSAFE_width"" doesn't appear in any official Appsmith widget documentation or recent GitHub issues regarding button components.

For width control in Button widgets, Appsmith provides these official methods:
- **Layout properties**: Standard width configuration through property pane settings[1][12]
- **Dynamic styling**: Programmatic control using JavaScript via `setColor()` method[1]
- **Theme alignment**: Style buttons using theme properties (`appsmith.theme`)[4]
- **CSS overrides**: Custom widget styling through CSS-in-JS patterns[6][11]

The ""UNSAFE_"" prefix typically indicates internal/experimental React APIs, but Appsmith's component API doesn't use this pattern for its widget properties[1][2]. For width modifications, use the standard width property or CSS-based approaches through Custom widgets[6][11].

For reference, here are the supported width-related patterns for buttons:

| Approach | Implementation | Use Case |
|----------|----------------|----------|
| Property Pane | Direct width adjustment in widget settings | Basic layout control |
| JS Methods | `setColor()` combined with icon positioning[7] | Dynamic styling |
| Custom CSS | Using Custom widget's CSS variables[6] | Brand-specific designs |
| Theme Sync | `appsmith.theme` properties for consistency[4] | App-wide styling |

**Action: Remove UNSAFE_width Prop for Consistency**  
The use of the `UNSAFE_width` prop in `DatasourceLinkControl.tsx` (line 48) isn’t supported by official Appsmith documentation. Since it doesn’t appear to be a documented or reliable property, please remove it and use a standard width configuration (e.g., via CSS or the widget’s property pane).  

- Remove `UNSAFE_width=""110px""` on line 48.
- Adopt one of the documented methods for width control as recommended in the Appsmith documentation.

You can get rid of portInitialized while you're at it."

I'm not sure of the best way to handle this.  Thoughts?

One idea: if the field is empty in the template, we take that to mean we're supposed to patch it in.  But if it is not empty, we assume the user meant to specify something, and it should be left alone.

If we do override something, we should probably print something so it is less likely to go unnoticed.  I could see this being a point of annoyance for users who are trying to set these fields."

Also, common.LoadConf loads the config to a global variable, which we then change, and without lock protection.  That's risky.  Can we make a version of common.LoadConf (w/ a different name) that returns a worker config instead of updating the global variable?   Then we could save the loaded config template in another field in LocalWorkerPoolPlatform, with full control over it and with locking (if needed). "

In library/embedding.py around lines 16 to 42, the embed function lacks error handling for network requests and image loading, which can cause unhandled exceptions. Add try-except blocks around the HTTP requests and image opening code to catch and handle potential errors gracefully. Additionally, after obtaining the image embeddings tensor, normalize it (e.g., using torch.nn.functional.normalize) before returning to improve similarity search performance.

**Error handling properly implemented for hex decoding**

The implementation now correctly handles the case when the cookie value isn't a valid hex string by checking the error returned from `hex.DecodeString()` and returning early.



However, this error handling code (lines 302-303) is not covered by tests. Consider adding a test case that sets an invalid hex string as the flash cookie value to verify that the function handles invalid input gracefully.

🏁 Script executed:

```shell
#!/bin/bash
# Check if there are tests for the invalid hex decoding case
rg -A 5 -B 5 'invalid.*hex|malformed.*cookie|bad.*cookie|FlashCookieName.*=.*[^a-fA-F0-9]' --glob ""*.go"" --type go
```

Length of output: 461

</details>

**Add unit test for invalid hex decoding of flash cookie**

The error handling around `hex.DecodeString(r.c.Cookies(FlashCookieName))` correctly returns early on malformed input, but there are no existing tests covering this case. Please add a test that:

- Sets `FlashCookieName` cookie to a non-hex string (e.g. `""zzzz""`).
- Invokes the handler/function in `redirect.go` that reads and decodes the flash cookie.
- Asserts that it returns gracefully (no panic) and behaves as expected (e.g., no flash data is processed).

Suggested location:
- File: `redirect_test.go` (or wherever related tests live)  
- Target lines around 300–303 in `redirect.go`.

**Verify NaN handling logic.**

Treating NaN as ""free fee"" seems questionable. NaN usually indicates a data problem, not a legitimate free fee scenario. This could mask real issues.

**Handle NaN fee values explicitly**

Treating `NaN` as a free fee hides data errors. Instead, validate the raw fee before deciding it’s “free.”

Suggested changes in packages/kit/src/views/Swap/pages/components/SwapQuoteResult.tsx (around lines 384–385):

```diff
- isFreeOneKeyFee={
-   new BigNumber(quoteResult?.fee?.percentageFee ?? '0').isZero() ||
-   new BigNumber(quoteResult?.fee?.percentageFee ?? '0').isNaN()
- }
+ // Parse the raw fee once
+ const rawFee = quoteResult?.fee?.percentageFee;
+ const feeBn = new BigNumber(rawFee ?? '0');
+
+ // Handle invalid data explicitly
+ if (feeBn.isNaN()) {
+   // TODO: log the error, surface a warning, or fallback to a safe default
+ }
+
+ // Now determine “free” status
+ const isFreeOneKeyFee = feeBn.isZero();
+
+ /* …later… */
+ isFreeOneKeyFee={isFreeOneKeyFee}
```

• Move the `.isNaN()` check out of the free-fee expression.  
• Log or surface errors when the fee value is invalid.  
• Keep the zero-fee check simple and clear.

384 to 385, the current code treats NaN percentageFee values as zero fees, which
can mask data issues. Refactor by separating the NaN check from the zero-fee
condition: first validate if the fee is NaN and handle this case explicitly by
logging or surfacing an error, then perform a simple check for zero fees. This
ensures invalid fee data is detected and not silently treated as free.

file with unwrap(), which will panic if the file is missing. Replace unwrap()

+
+    for i in 0..items_per_row {

```

Then use it for each row:
```diff

with_zoom_limits constructor lacks validation to ensure min_zoom is less than
max_zoom. Add a check at the start of the function to verify min_zoom < max_zoom
and handle the invalid case, for example by panicking with a clear error message
or returning a Result type to prevent creating an invalid camera state.

**Eliminate code duplication between `From<&FigmaPaint>` and `convert_paint`.**

The `convert_paint` method duplicates the entire logic from the `From<&FigmaPaint>` implementation. This makes the code harder to maintain and increases the risk of inconsistencies.

2555140957,2129296465,jakebailey,,,"Probably it's worth doing this on main; we really only want to kill the LS when a panic happens during the handling of a critical message, otherwise it should just be returning an error or something.

It's also possible to store off onto the LS the error and then in the test harness check after each use that no new errors appeared."
2555140957,2129311309,jakebailey,,,"This is probably going to require some form of synchronization when we do start calling it.

Just to expand further on what I think we should do as an alternative:

The LSP allows servers to call back into the client and ask for configuration (e.g., VS Code settings), and also ask the client to send a notification when that configuration has changed. This means that if we want to allow the user to override the default configuration, we'd call back into the client for the info and register a ""watcher"" on it. Then, any configuration changes would come in as plain messages and be correctly synchronized by the handler loop.

This is not something I would expect in this PR whatsoever, obviously."
2555140957,2129324675,jakebailey,,,"I feel suspicious of the concurrency in this, solely because it will become normal for the server to make calls back into the client (which can then make calls back into the server, ad infinitum).

Channels are the right thing of course, maybe this is just something to consider when writing the harness itself, which sends off a request and then is presumably sitting there waiting for the reply to the request."

`ITabHeaderInstance` is not exported from the path you used.  
The linter already fails (`Module ... has no exported member 'ITabHeaderInstance'`).

If the type truly lives under `TabView/Header`, export it from the package’s barrel first, then import from `@onekeyhq/components`.

**Keep `filterType` in sync when locale changes**

`filterType` is initialised with `tabTitles[0].title` (the translated “All”).  
When the user switches language, `tabTitles` recomputes, but `filterType` stays in the **old** language string, so `isInAllTab` becomes `false` and all filters break.

Add an effect to resync:

```diff
 const [filterType, setFilterType] = useState(tabTitles[0].title);

 useEffect(() => {
-  // nothing
+  setFilterType(tabTitles[0].title);
 }, [tabTitles]);

This runs only when `intl` changes, so perf impact is negligible.

**Avoid using `any` for the `ref` prop.**

Casting to `any` silences TypeScript errors but sacrifices type safety. Instead, narrow the type to the header’s instance interface:

```diff

+ ref={pageManager.headerView as React.ForwardedRef<ITabHeaderInstance>}

Or update `PageManager.headerView` to match `RefObject<ITabHeaderInstance>`. This will ensure proper typing for the `scrollToIndex` imperative handle.

As `_extConfig` is not actually an `IConfiguration`, because of the way this is fetched on line 639 it's actually going to be value config from `extensionConfig.ApplicationInsightsAnalytics....` where it's values will only be those from 55..72 (plus any merged root values from the core config).

So there are 2 problems here
- passing `_extConfig` won't actually pass the root config with the new config populated
- The code which defines `_extConfig` (lines 124 and defaults (55...72) is ""technically"" not correct -- this really requires a ""new"" interface to be defined which identifies that `_extConfig` (and the defaults) are a sub-set and specific to this extension.

Another scenario - what happens if the script fails on line 165 above? The repo will have a half-baked installation, from which is more difficult to recover.
The best way to reduce the complexity damage caused by exception handling is to reduce the number of places where exceptions have to be handled.

In this particular case, a design that can do that is having the code commited to a PR. From Shortest's perpective:
* if the PR build is green, then the setup was successful, and it can be merged
* if for any reason it fails mid-way, or there are other issues, we could just trash it, and try again (don't have to go into specific edge cases and try to recover from there)

2390483014,1993437420,lsorber,,,"I have two comments and see one opportunity here:
1. Comment: we should merge short sentences before we apply additional splits and do recursive splitting, because the merging of short sentences may itself lead to sentences that are larger than the `max_len` boundary.
2. Comment: similarly to `max_len`, I think we should introduce a `min_len` argument, which has a default of say 10 characters.
3. Opportunity: the `merge_short_sentences` adds quite a few lines of code to this module. If instead of merging sentences, we filter the `split_indices` I think we can reduce it to a few additional lines after the `split_indices` line:

```python
candidate_split_indices = np.where(probas > sentence_threshold)[0]
sentence_len = np.diff(np.insert(split_indices, 0, 0))
split_indices = candidate_split_indices[sentence_len >= 10]
```"
2390483014,1993448569,lsorber,,,"Note: this is a reasonable but not necessarily optimal way of grouping sentences that are too short. For instance, there may be an opportunity to concatenate a sequence of two short sentences so that the newly created sentence is larger than the minimum sentence length. In that case, you don't need to append the newly created sentence to the previous or next sentence in the list.

If we want, we could do something similar as we do with optimal chunking where we cast this as an optimization problem with the objective of removing as few split indices as possible (each with their own 'probability' as the loss value of removing that split index) under the constraint that no two split indices are allowed to be closer than 10 characters apart. That said, I'm not sure that this is worth the effort compared to the 'simple' solution of simply filtering them out as the above 3 lines do."
2390483014,1993523588,lsorber,,,"I also see that we already have this logic too:
```python
    # For consecutive high probability sentence boundaries, keep only the first one.
    sentence_threshold = 0.25  # Default threshold for -sm models.
    split_indices = np.where(probas > sentence_threshold)[0]
    for split_index in split_indices:
        if probas[split_index] > sentence_threshold:
            probas[split_index + 1 : split_index + 3] = 0

I agree—I initially considered a similar approach. However, I drew inspiration from how short_term and entity_memory utilize the mem0 memory and aimed to keep the codebase consistent.

The crew parameter could indeed be removed, and only the necessary parameters could be passed. However, after reviewing how other memory types are initialized, I noticed that the crew parameter is consistently used throughout the codebase. To maintain consistency, I chose not to modify that part."

```

```

Probably we can rebase this PR on @mconnew which should fix these missing assemblies."
2330184220,1953515232,mconnew,,,"I think this is another bug in API compat tooling. WSTrustTokenParameters has the new keyword because when the class was first introduced, the base class didn't have a KeySize property. The base class did have a KeySize property exposed on NetFx and was brought back, so the definition in WSTrustTokenParameters needed the new keyword so that it didn't become binary incompatible. This hasn't changed single 6.1.0."
2330184220,1953549333,mconnew,,,"The next version will be 8.1.2. It looks like @HongGit doesn't update this version number until we're ready to build, so the comparison should be with 8.1.1 and not 8.1.0."
2330184220,1953572913,mconnew,,,"This looks like a genuine problem, this api is listed in the netstandard reference assembly but isn't public on .NET Framework, so should only be in our net8 reference assembly."
2330184220,1953608811,mconnew,,,"@ericstj, do you know what's going on with these three? As far as I can tell, these are correct. The CP0008 error means a base interface was removed from the interface hierarchy from one of the compared sides. Is this caused by Attribute no longer implementing the interface `_Attribute`? Is this an API compat tool bug as the interface is defined on Attribute, which is external to these packages so isn't a difference between WCF Client packages."
2330184220,1953635425,ericstj,,,"I'll have a closer look at this and the others.  The logged messages give a bit more context - @ViktorHofer has improved human readability of the suppression files in later 10.0 releases.

A lot of times you still need to look at the metadata to understand what's going on.  I'll have a review and add detail by mid-day tomorrow."
2330184220,1954956981,ericstj,,,"Yeah, it does seem to be off:
```
CP0002: Member 'System.Nullable<int> System.ServiceModel.Federation.WSTrustTokenParameters.KeySize.get' exists on [Baseline] lib/net8.0/System.ServiceModel.Federation.dll but not on lib/netstandard2.0/System.ServiceModel.Federation.dll
```

This has to do with comparing the previous `net8.0` asset with the new `netstandard2.0` asset.  You'll only face this issue across this one baseline comparison.  Details here https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/46834."
2330184220,1954988890,ericstj,,,"Yeah, it's `System.Runtime.InteropServices._Attribute`
```
Type 'System.Web.Services.Configuration.XmlFormatExtensionAttribute' does not implement interface 'System.Runtime.InteropServices._Attribute' on ref/netstandard2.0/System.Web.Services.Description.dll but it does on lib/net462/System.Web.Services.Description.dll
```

The reason we flag it is because when folks use references (`ref` folder) we do a *strict* comparison, because we expect folks want to expose all public API in their references that are in the lib.  They can then suppress those that differ.

This particular package has this structure:
```
lib\net462
lib\netstandard2.0
ref\netstandard2.0
```

As a result, when looking at the `lib\net462` implementation and say ""all it's public API should be exposed by it's reference"" - the `ref\netstandard2.0` one.  We see that `_Attribute` is not there -- thus this error.

You're doing a couple things I'd advise against:
1. If you use ref - you should really aim for 1/1 references with lib.  Especially when it comes to netframework - to avoid the need to bring in the giant netstandard support facade set.
2. Don't use ref if you don't have to.  We've really shied away from using `ref` just because there are too many .NET Framework design time tools that don't work well with reference assemblies.  We only use `ref` for our targeting packs anymore.

The `ProxyAgent` is currently created (including the `require('undici')` call) every time `createFetchOptions` is invoked and a proxy URL is configured. If proxy environment variables are not expected to change during the `PricingFetcher` instance's lifetime, consider initializing the `ProxyAgent` once and caching it.

This can be achieved by introducing a private class member to store the agent (or a status indicating no proxy/error) and initializing it on the first call to `createFetchOptions` or in the constructor.

This would avoid redundant `require` calls and `ProxyAgent` instantiations, potentially improving performance slightly if this method is called frequently for a long-lived `PricingFetcher` instance.

Example of a lazy-initialization approach:

```typescript
// Add a private member to the class:
// private proxyAgentInternal: import('undici').ProxyAgent | null | 'uninitialized' = 'uninitialized';

// Modify createFetchOptions:
private createFetchOptions(): RequestInit {
    if (this.proxyAgentInternal === 'uninitialized') {
        const httpsProxy = process.env.HTTPS_PROXY ?? process.env.https_proxy ?? '';
        const httpProxy = process.env.HTTP_PROXY ?? process.env.http_proxy ?? '';
        const proxyUrl = httpsProxy.length > 0 ? httpsProxy : httpProxy;

        if (proxyUrl.length === 0) {
            this.proxyAgentInternal = null;
        } else {
            try {
                // eslint-disable-next-line ts/no-require-imports
                const { ProxyAgent } = require('undici') as typeof import('undici');
                this.proxyAgentInternal = new ProxyAgent(proxyUrl);
                logger.info(`Fetching with proxy: ${proxyUrl}`);
            } catch (error) {
                logger.warn('Failed to create proxy agent, attempting direct connection:', error);
                this.proxyAgentInternal = null;
            }
        }
    }

    if (this.proxyAgentInternal) {
        return {
            dispatcher: this.proxyAgentInternal as RequestInit['dispatcher'],
        };
    }
    return {};

The current proxy implementation correctly handles `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY`. However, it doesn't appear to consider the `NO_PROXY` (or `no_proxy`) environment variable. This variable is standard for specifying hosts or domains that should bypass the configured proxy.

`undici`'s `ProxyAgent` itself does not automatically parse or respect `NO_PROXY`. If `LITELLM_PRICING_URL` (or any future URLs fetched using this mechanism) needs to be excludable from proxying via `NO_PROXY`, this logic would need to be implemented within `createFetchOptions`.

This would involve:
1. Reading the `NO_PROXY` environment variable.
2. Parsing its contents (which can be a comma-separated list of domains, IP addresses, CIDR blocks).
3. Checking if the target URL matches any of the `NO_PROXY` patterns.
4. If it matches, return an empty options object `{}` to bypass the proxy, even if `HTTP_PROXY` or `HTTPS_PROXY` is set.

Adding support for `NO_PROXY` would make the proxy handling more robust and align better with user expectations in corporate or complex network environments."
2586152525,2141782364,gemini-code-assist[bot],,,"![medium](https://www.gstatic.com/codereviewagent/medium-priority.svg)

The use of dynamic `require('undici')` is noted, and the `eslint-disable` comment indicates this is intentional. Given the PR description mentions fixing issues with compiled binaries, this is likely a targeted solution.

To aid future maintainers in understanding this choice (as static `import` is generally preferred for direct dependencies), consider adding a brief inline comment explaining *why* `require` is necessary or preferred over `import` in this specific context. For example, if it relates to a particular bundler behavior or a characteristic of the `undici` package when bundled.

This would enhance code clarity and prevent potential 'refactoring' attempts that might reintroduce the original problem.

```suggestion
			const { ProxyAgent } = require('undici') as typeof import('undici'); // Using require for undici due to [specific reason, e.g., bundler compatibility with static imports]

_⚠️ Potential issue_

**`require()` inside ESM/bun causes portability problems – import `ProxyAgent` normally**

`require()` is not available in pure ESM and adds an unnecessary `ts/no-unsafe-*` cascade.  
A safe, tree-shakable pattern is to promote the import to the module level (or use
dynamic `await import()` if you really want lazy loading).

```diff
-import process from 'node:process';
+import process from 'node:process';
+import { ProxyAgent, type Dispatcher } from 'undici';
 ...
-private createFetchOptions(): RequestInit {
+private createFetchOptions(): RequestInit {
   …
-  try {
-    // eslint-disable-next-line ts/no-require-imports
-    const { ProxyAgent } = require('undici') as typeof import('undici');
-    const proxyAgent = new ProxyAgent(proxyUrl);
+  try {
+    const proxyAgent: Dispatcher = new ProxyAgent(proxyUrl);
```

Benefits:

* Works the same in Node, Bun and the bundle emitted by `tsdown`.
* Removes the `no-require-imports` override and most `no-unsafe-*` ESLint noise.
* Eliminates runtime branching – errors surface at startup rather than mid-fetch.

Of course, if the issue is a coding error, it won't be resolved until the developer fixes it. In my experience, 500 internal server errors are usually solved pretty quickly in case the cause us a bug, which would mean that any other 500 errors are shorter-lived even.

**Resolve documentation-code mismatch for key bindings.**

The README mentions F10 for menu bar toggling, but the code implements F1, F2, and F3 keys. This inconsistency should be resolved either by:
1. Updating the README to reflect the actual F1, F2, F3 key bindings, or
2. Updating the code to use F10 as documented

<!-- This is an auto-generated comment by CodeRabbit -->"
2278672274,1919899860,coderabbitai[bot],,,"_:warning: Potential issue_

**Update key binding documentation.**

The documentation incorrectly states that F10 is used for toggling the menu bar. The actual implementation uses:
- F1 to toggle the menu bar
- F2 to show the menu bar
- F3 to hide the menu bar

# Window Menu Example

*** Windows Only ***

This example demonstrates how to create a window with a menu bar that can be toggled using the window.ToggleMenuBar() method.

## Features

- Default menu bar with File, Edit, and Help menus
- F1 key to toggle menu bar visibility 
- F2 key to show menu bar
- F3 key to hide menu bar
- Simple HTML interface with instructions

## Running the Example

```bash
cd v3/examples/window-menu
go run .
```

## How it Works

The example creates a window with a default menu and binds function keys for menu bar control:
- F1 toggles the menu bar visibility
- F2 shows the menu bar
- F3 hides the menu bar
```

You mark `removedAccountIds` as optional, but you always include the field (it defaults to an empty array). Either:

1. Remove the `?` in the return type, or  
2. Only attach the property when the array has items.

Option 1 keeps things simpler and avoids an unnecessary `undefined | []` union.

**RLS enabled without a policy blocks everyone**

You enable row-level security on the queue tables but do **not** define any `POLICY`.  
With Postgres defaults, *all* access is rejected despite the privileges you grant, so your worker will be unable to read / archive messages.

Create a permissive policy (or disable RLS) **before** deploying:

```sql
ALTER TABLE pgmq.q_grida_hosted_evt_new_organization_jobs
  DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
-- or
CREATE POLICY pgmq_queue_policy
  ON pgmq.q_grida_hosted_evt_new_organization_jobs
  FOR ALL
  USING (true);

row-level security (RLS) is enabled on the queue tables without defining any RLS
policy, which blocks all access despite granted privileges. To fix this, either
disable RLS on the affected tables before deployment or create a permissive
policy allowing all access by adding a CREATE POLICY statement with USING (true)
for the relevant tables. This ensures the worker can read and archive messages
as intended.

The JSON structure described in the documentation has several discrepancies compared to the actual JSON output:

1.  The `firstseen` field, which is output by the C code, is missing.
2.  Key name mismatches:
    *   Doc: `senderid` vs. C code: `sender`
    *   Doc: `last-event-time` vs. C code: `lastseen`
    *   Doc: `message-count` vs. C code: `messages`
3.  Data type mismatches:
    *   `messages`: Documented as a string placeholder, but C code outputs it as a number (uint64_t).
    *   `last-event-time` (doc) / `lastseen` (C): Documented as an ISO 8601 string, but C code outputs `time_t` as a number (Unix epoch seconds).
    *   `firstseen`: C code outputs `time_t` as a number (Unix epoch seconds).

The documentation must accurately reflect the field names, keys, and data types produced by the module.

```

   {
     ""sender"": ""value_from_template"",
     ""messages"": 12345,
     ""firstseen"": 1678886400,
     ""lastseen"": 1678886460
     // ""avg-message-count"": 10.5 // Placeholder for an optional, future field
   }

Where:

* ``sender``: The unique identifier for the sender, as determined by the
    :ref:`senderid <omsendertrack_senderid>` template.
* ``messages``: The total number of messages received from this sender
    since tracking began (or since the last reset), as an integer.
* ``firstseen``: A Unix timestamp (integer, seconds since epoch) indicating when the
    first message from this sender was received.
* ``lastseen``: A Unix timestamp (integer, seconds since epoch) indicating when the
    last message from this sender was received.
* ``avg-message-count``: (Optional) The average message rate from this sender
    since tracking began, calculated over the total elapsed time. This field's
    presence depends on future module configuration and implementation details.

The documentation states the default for `senderid` is ""RSYSLOG_FileFormat"". However, the C code has an issue: if `senderid` is not set, the module will attempt to use a template named ""TODO_WHICH_ONE"". If a template with this name is not defined, rsyslog will likely error.

To avoid user confusion with this PoC version, it's crucial to clarify this. I recommend adding an 'Important' note under the `senderid` parameter description, similar to this:

```rst
.. important::

   **Note for Proof-of-Concept:** While the conceptual default template is ``RSYSLOG_FileFormat``, the current PoC version will attempt to use a template named ``TODO_WHICH_ONE`` if ``senderid`` is not specified. As this template is unlikely to be defined by users, **it is strongly recommended to always explicitly specify the ``senderid`` parameter in your configuration** for this module version to ensure predictable behavior.
```

This allows the table to list ""RSYSLOG_FileFormat"" as the intended eventual default while clearly warning about the current PoC behavior."
2597666759,2151407271,gemini-code-assist[bot],,,"![medium](https://www.gstatic.com/codereviewagent/medium-priority.svg)

The statement ""There are currently **no statistics counters available** in this proof-of-concept version of the module"" might be slightly misleading. While `omsendertrack` doesn't expose counters via `impstats` the JSON state file itself *is* the repository of collected statistics.

For better clarity, consider rephrasing this note. For example:

""**Note:** In this proof-of-concept version, the module does not expose statistics via the `impstats` module. The primary method to access the collected sender data is by consuming the JSON `statefile` described below.""

My reasoning is that here a repo can be tagged as `adapter: ""lora""` in the provider's mapping but it's only when we try to use it client-side that we get the error because adapters weights file cannot be found. Ideally it would be nice if:
1. the check can be done server-side when mapping is created

yes actually when you suggested to have a dataclass matching the js one, i thought maybe we can just use `InferenceProviderMapping` but that would require to make `hf_model_id` optional (so not really matching the js interface). "
2460147666,2053831284,Wauplin,,,artificially adding `hf_model_id` to the `InferenceProviderMapping` object is not really a problem IMO (this is an information we already have when making the `model_info` call)

A bit of a hack indeed
You have to provide the base model id when calling fal's https://fal.ai/models/fal-ai/lora/api

As expected, the verification didn't go smoothly.  
I'm testing this on **macOS** using **Docker for Mac**.

Here are the steps I followed—please review them!

---

### Steps

```bash
# Navigate to the CLI package
[liam]$ cd ./frontend/packages/cli

# Pack the CLI package
[cli]$ npm pack

# ...snip...

# Output file
liam-hq-cli-0.3.3.tgz

# Create a temporary working directory on macOS (this does not have a package.json)
[cli]$ rm -rf /tmp/work1
[cli]$ mkdir -p /tmp/work1
[cli]$ mv liam-hq-cli-0.3.3.tgz /tmp/work1
[cli]$ cd /tmp/work1

# Run Docker with a Node environment
[work1]$ docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/app -w /app node:20-bullseye bash

# Inside the Docker container, verify the package exists
root@8ab6f9d75ac0:/app# ls -alF
total 2176
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root      96 Feb  5 07:50 ./
drwxr-xr-x 1 root root    4096 Feb  5 07:50 ../
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 2223693 Feb  5 07:50 liam-hq-cli-0.3.3.tgz

# Try installing the package
root@8ab6f9d75ac0:/app# npm i ./liam-hq-cli-0.3.3.tgz

# ...snip...

# Check the exit code
root@8ab6f9d75ac0:/app# echo $?
```

---

### Result: On the **main** branch

The installation **succeeds**.

---

### Result: On **this** branch

The installation **fails**.

```bash
root@8ab6f9d75ac0:/app# npm i ./liam-hq-cli-0.3.3.tgz

### Creating GitHub Issue for Composite Constraint Structure ✅

#### Todo List:
- [x] Analyze the current composite constraint structure issue
- [x] Create GitHub issue describing the problem and proposed solution
- [x] Update comment with issue link

#### GitHub Issue Created:
✅ **Issue #2260**: [Fix composite primary key and unique constraint structure in PostgreSQL parser](https://github.com/liam-hq/liam/issues/2260)

The issue describes:
- **Problem**: Current parser creates separate constraint entries for each column in composite primary keys/unique constraints
- **Expected behavior**: Single constraint entry with `columnNames` array  
- **Impact**: Affects schema accuracy and UI display
- **Breaking change**: Notes this would require schema structure changes
- **References**: Links back to this PR and review comment

The issue has been labeled with `bug`, `parser`, `postgresql`, and `breaking-change` tags for proper categorization.

_⚠️ Potential issue_

**非同期チェーンが例外で停止し次回以降の発話が実行されなくなる恐れがあります**  

`prevFetchPromise` に `processAndSynthesizePromise`（= 例外が reject される可能性のある Promise）をそのまま代入しているため、  
一度でも reject された場合、**後続呼び出しの `prevFetchPromise.then()` が実行されず全ての発話が詰まる** 状態になります。  
チェーンを切らさないよう、ここでは *必ず resolve で返す* Promise を `prevFetchPromise` に保存してください。

例として下記のように catch でエラーを握りつぶしつつ resolve を返す形が安全です。

```diff
-    prevFetchPromise = processAndSynthesizePromise
-
-    processAndSynthesizePromise
+    prevFetchPromise = processAndSynthesizePromise.catch((err) => {
+      console.error('Speak chain error (swallowed):', err)
+      // 後続処理を止めないために resolve で返す
+      return null
+    })
+
+    processAndSynthesizePromise
```

これにより、どのタスクでエラーが起きても後続タスクの実行が保証されます。

**Consider adding error handling for external tax calculation services.**

The service doesn't handle potential failures from the `SalesTaxCalculator` or TaxJar API calls. If these external services fail, the error will bubble up unhandled.

+  rescue => e
+    Rails.logger.error ""Tax calculation failed for purchase #{@purchase.id}: #{e.message}""
+    # Depending on business requirements, either:

+    # 2. Continue without tax calculation
+    # 3. Apply a default tax rate

   apply_tax_calculation(tax_calculation)
 
   @purchase.was_purchase_taxable = @purchase.gumroad_tax_cents > 0 || @purchase.tax_cents > 0

call method lacks error handling for failures from external tax calculation
services like SalesTaxCalculator or TaxJar API. Wrap the tax calculation logic,

**Optimize calculator instantiation to avoid redundant object creation.**

The method creates a `SalesTaxCalculator` instance on line 41 solely to check `is_us_taxable_state` and `is_ca_taxable`. This same calculator is then rebuilt in the main `call` method on line 16, resulting in redundant object creation and potential performance impact.

**Add error handling for database operations and simplify the implementation.**

In app/services/purchase/tax_calculation_service.rb around lines 94 to 110, the
update_taxjar_info method uses tap unnecessarily and calls save! without error
handling, which can raise exceptions on validation failure. Refactor the method
to assign the tax rates directly to the taxjar_info object without using tap,
then wrap the save! call in a begin-rescue block to catch and handle potential
exceptions gracefully, such as logging the error or re-raising with a clear

**Enhance test coverage for SendEarlyHints functionality.**

The current test only verifies that the `SendEarlyHints` method can be called without returning an error, but it doesn't validate the actual early hints behavior. For an HTTP 103 Early Hints implementation, the test should verify:

1. That HTTP 103 status code is used for early hints
2. That Link headers are properly set in the response
3. That the early hints are sent before the final response



Consider enhancing the test like this:

```diff
 // go test -race -run Test_Ctx_SendEarlyHints
 func Test_Ctx_SendEarlyHints(t *testing.T) {
 	t.Parallel()
 	app := New()
 
 	c := app.AcquireCtx(&fasthttp.RequestCtx{})
 	err := c.SendEarlyHints([]string{""<https://cdn.com>; rel=preload; as=script""})
 	require.NoError(t, err)
+	
+	// Verify that early hints were properly set
+	// Note: This will depend on the actual implementation of SendEarlyHints
+	// You may need to check if headers were set or if the method interacts with the response correctly
+	
+	// Example assertions (adjust based on actual implementation):
+	// require.Equal(t, 103, c.Response().StatusCode()) // if early hints sets status
+	// require.Contains(t, string(c.Response().Header.Peek(""Link"")), ""https://cdn.com"")
 
 	app.ReleaseCtx(c)
 }

Additionally, consider adding more comprehensive test cases:
- Multiple Link headers
- Invalid Link header formats
- Edge cases like empty hints array
- Integration test that verifies the complete early hints flow

In ctx_test.go around lines 3107 to 3118, the Test_Ctx_SendEarlyHints function
only checks for the absence of errors when calling SendEarlyHints but does not
verify the actual HTTP 103 status code, the presence and correctness of Link
headers, or that early hints are sent before the final response. To fix this,
enhance the test by asserting that the response status code is 103 after sending
early hints, verify that the Link headers are correctly set in the response, and
confirm that these headers are sent prior to the final response. Additionally,
add test cases covering multiple Link headers, invalid header formats, empty
hints arrays, and an integration test to validate the full early hints flow.

**Fix logical inconsistency in status code handling.**

There's a contradiction in the test logic: the handler sets the status to `StatusBadRequest` (400) on line 3115, but the test expects `StatusEarlyHints` (103) on line 3126. 

Early hints (HTTP 103) should be sent before the final response, and the test should verify the final response status, not the early hints status.



Consider this approach:
```diff
 	hints := []string{""<https://cdn.com>; rel=preload; as=script""}
 	app.Get(""/earlyhints"", func(c Ctx) error {
-		c.SendEarlyHints(hints)
-		c.Status(StatusBadRequest)
+		err := c.SendEarlyHints(hints)
+		if err != nil {
+			return err
+		}
+		c.Status(StatusOK)
 		return nil
 	})
```

And update the assertion:
```diff
-	require.Equal(t, StatusEarlyHints, resp.StatusCode, ""Status code"")
+	require.Equal(t, StatusOK, resp.StatusCode, ""Status code"")
```

```
In ctx_test.go around lines 3114 to 3116, the handler sets the response status
to StatusBadRequest (400) but the test incorrectly expects StatusEarlyHints
(103) as the final status. Fix this by ensuring the test asserts the final
response status as StatusBadRequest (400) instead of StatusEarlyHints (103),
since early hints are preliminary and the final status should reflect the actual
response status set by the handler.

**Verify early hints implementation addresses race condition concerns.**

While this test follows the previous suggestion to use `app.Test()`, the PR comments mention ongoing race condition issues with the SendEarlyHints functionality. Consider adding additional verification to ensure the early hints are properly sent before the final response.



You might want to verify that this test implementation actually resolves the race condition issues mentioned in the PR discussion. Consider adding test cases that verify:
1. Early hints are sent before final response
2. Multiple early hints can be sent
3. The functionality works correctly under concurrent load

**Extend SendEarlyHints tests for multiple hints and concurrent use**

The current Test_Ctx_SendEarlyHints in ctx_test.go only covers a single hint and a single request. We haven’t found any tests addressing multiple hints or concurrent execution, nor verifying that early hints are flushed before the final status. Please add the following:

• In ctx_test.go (around lines 3107–3128):  
  – Add a subtest that calls `c.SendEarlyHints` with multiple values (e.g. two distinct Link headers) and asserts `resp.Header[""Link""]` contains both entries.  
  – Verify that calling `c.Status(...)` after `SendEarlyHints` does not override the 103 response.  

• Still in ctx_test.go:  
  – Introduce `Test_Ctx_SendEarlyHints_Concurrent` with `t.Parallel()` and spawn multiple `app.Test(httptest.NewRequest(...))` invocations (e.g. via a `sync.WaitGroup`) to confirm no data races under load.

**Optimize mapping logic by moving it outside the loop.**

The fix correctly addresses the core issue, but the mapping logic is executed repeatedly for every log entry, which is inefficient. Consider moving the mapping outside the loop for better performance.



Apply this diff to optimize the performance:

```diff
         // Convert log entries to a JSON array, filtering by logType if provided
         JArray logsArray = new JArray();
         bool filter = !string.IsNullOrEmpty(logType);
+        
+        // Map MCP log types to Unity log types (done once before filtering)
+        string unityLogType = logType;
+        if (filter && logType.Equals(""info"", System.StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase))
+            unityLogType = ""Log"";
         
         lock (_logEntries)
         {
             foreach (var entry in _logEntries)
             {
-                // Map MCP log types to Unity log types
-                string unityLogType = logType;
-                if (logType.Equals(""info"", System.StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase))
-                    unityLogType = ""Log"";
-                
                 if (filter && !entry.Type.ToString().Equals(unityLogType, System.StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase))
                     continue;
```

For future extensibility, consider using a static mapping dictionary:

```csharp
private static readonly Dictionary<string, string> LogTypeMapping = new Dictionary<string, string>(StringComparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase)
{
    { ""info"", ""Log"" }
    // Add more mappings as needed
};

// Then in the method:
string unityLogType = filter && LogTypeMapping.TryGetValue(logType, out string mapped) ? mapped : logType;
```

<details>
<summary>🤖 Prompt for AI Agents</summary>

```
In Editor/Services/ConsoleLogsService.cs around lines 83 to 88, the mapping of
MCP log types to Unity log types is done inside a loop, causing repeated and
inefficient execution. To fix this, move the mapping logic outside the loop by
creating a static dictionary that maps MCP log types to Unity log types, then
use this dictionary to get the mapped log type once before processing entries.
Replace the inline conditional mapping with a dictionary lookup that defaults to
the original log type if no mapping exists.
```

Disable the delete button while the request is in progress to prevent multiple submissions and potential race conditions.

Suggested implementation:

```typescript
  const [isRenameModalOpen, setIsRenameModalOpen] = React.useState(false);
  const [isDeleteModalOpen, setIsDeleteModalOpen] = React.useState(false);
  const [isDeleting, setIsDeleting] = React.useState(false);

```

```typescript
  const handleDelete = async () => {
    if (!selectedSession || isDeleting) return;
    setIsDeleting(true);
    try {
      await deleteChatSession(selectedSession.id);
      toast.success(t('chat.delete_success'));
      fetchSessions();
      setIsDeleteModalOpen(false);
      setSelectedSession(null);
    } catch (error) {
      toast.error(t('chat.delete_failed'));
    } finally {
      setIsDeleting(false);
    }
  };

```

You must also update the delete button in your delete modal to use the `isDeleting` state. For example, if your modal's delete button looks like this:

```tsx
<Button onClick={handleDelete}>
  {t('chat.delete')}
</Button>
```

Change it to:

```tsx
<Button onClick={handleDelete} disabled={isDeleting}>
  {isDeleting ? t('chat.deleting') : t('chat.delete')}
</Button>
```

Make sure to import or define the `t('chat.deleting')` translation if it doesn't exist."

2545170205,2108672126,lyenrowe,,,"If no error, stream.Err() return nil. The purpose is to expose connection failures to the LLM as early as possible."
2545170205,2108673039,sourcery-ai[bot],,,"That makes sense—you want to fail fast on “can’t even establish the SSE stream” errors. The only problem is that callers of  
   
   stream, err := ChatCompletionStream(...)  
   
will see an error immediately via the `err` return, even if they haven’t actually tried to read anything yet. That can lead to odd code paths where the client bails out before they’ve even started streaming.

A middle ground might be:

1. In `ChatCompletionStream`, do a tiny “probe” read on the underlying HTTP response to verify you can connect, then return `stream, nil`.  
2. If that probe fails, surface it as your `err`.  
3. Leave the real-time `.Err()` on `stream` for any errors that happen mid-stream.

Something like:

```go
func (c *Client) ChatCompletionStream(…) (ChatStream, error) {
    stream := … // same as before

    // Probe the connection—e.g. read a single byte or do a non-blocking ping
    if _, probeErr := stream.PeekFirst(); probeErr != nil {
        stream.Close()
        return nil, probeErr
    }

    return stream, nil
}
```

That way callers still get a clean `err!=nil` if the SSE connection dies immediately, but you don’t conflate that initial check with all the downstream streaming errors. Does that approach look workable?"

**Verify how ""Average hours"" are calculated after removing hours_per_week.**

The test removes `hours_per_week` from contractor creation but still expects ""Average hours"" values in the table assertions (lines 25, 39, 47, 55). This could indicate a test-data mismatch.

**Average hours display broken after dropping hours_per_week**

The migration removed `hours_per_week` from `company_contractors`, but:

- The UI/tests still render an “Average hours” column with hard-coded expectations.
- There’s no `average_hours` method in the presenter, model, or view to supply those values.

You’ll need to either:
- Re-introduce an `average_hours` implementation (e.g. delegate to a new `available_hours_per_week` or derive from `unit_of_work`/`equity_percentage`), update the view to call it, and ensure it matches the spec; or
- Remove/update the “Average hours” assertions in  
  - `backend/spec/system/company/company_workers/listing_spec.rb` (lines 25, 39, 47, 55)  
  - The corresponding view template under `app/views/...company_workers`

```
In backend/spec/system/company/company_workers/listing_spec.rb around lines 6 to
15, the test setup still assumes the presence of an average hours attribute
which was removed in the migration. To fix this, either implement an
average_hours method in the model or presenter that calculates or delegates the
value appropriately, update the view to use this method, and adjust the specs to
expect the correct values; or remove the average hours related assertions from
the spec and update the corresponding view template to no longer display or rely
on average hours.

**Inconsistency: pay_rate_type should also be removed.**

The documentation correctly removes `hours_per_week` but still references `pay_rate_type` in the `worker_params` hash. According to the AI summary, both `pay_rate_type` and `hours_per_week` should be replaced with `unit_of_work`.

**Pay Rate Nullability: Ensure All Code Paths Handle nil**  

- CompanyWorker model now allows `pay_rate_in_subunits` to be `nil` (`allow_nil: true`).  
- GrantStockOptionsService already guards against `nil` and returns an error if the pay rate isn’t set.  

Potential gaps requiring fixes:  
- **QuickBooks Integration** (`app/serializers/quickbooks/company_worker_serializer.rb`):  
  ```ruby
  BillRate: pay_rate_in_subunits / 100.0
  ```  
  will raise if `pay_rate_in_subunits` is `nil`. Add a safe fallback (e.g. `pay_rate_in_subunits.to_i / 100.0`) or skip sync when no rate is set.  

- **Seed Data Generator** (`app/services/seed_data_generator_from_template.rb`):  
  ```ruby
  pay_rate_in_subunits: company_worker.pay_rate_in_subunits
  ```  
  may pass `nil` into invoice line items, which enforce presence. Ensure the template either supplies a default or skips generating line items when the rate is unset.  

- **Front-end Presenter** (`app/presenters/user_presenter.rb` / `company_worker_presenter.rb`):  
  Confirm the UI can gracefully display or omit a `null` payRateInSubunits.

In backend/db/schema.rb at line 141, the pay_rate_in_subunits column is now

calculation to use a safe fallback like pay_rate_in_subunits.to_i / 100.0 to
avoid errors when nil. In app/services/seed_data_generator_from_template.rb,

skip generating invoice line items that require a pay rate. Also, verify in

**Consider simplifying the dual state management between payRateType and unitOfWork.**

The current implementation maintains two separate but synchronized fields (`payRateType` and `unitOfWork`), which creates complexity and potential for bugs. Since these fields are tightly coupled, consider:

1. Using only `unitOfWork` in the schema and deriving the UI state for the radio buttons
2. Or keeping only `payRateType` and deriving `unitOfWork` when submitting

This would eliminate the need for complex bidirectional synchronization.

2597381928,2151217714,graphite-app[bot],,,"The image compression logic currently drops files silently when compression fails. If `compressImage(file)` returns `undefined` (on error), the code skips to the next file without processing the original image. Consider adding a fallback to handle the original file when compression fails:

```javascript
if (file.type.startsWith('image/')) {
    const compressedFile = await compressImage(file);
    
    if (compressedFile) {
        processedFiles.push({
            path: relativePath,
            content: compressedFile,
            isBinary: true,

	=> false
	
	pry(main)> link.update_flag! :moderated_by_iffy, true

Also replace the instance on line 152 with this same `executionResult` on line 152 so that the starting time will be handled for the non `asyncPreserveInputOrderForOutputMessages` case of async processing.
With these changes, the solution would have the basics in place. There would also need to be a way to test all of this. 

For testing, it might be useful to have a `java.util.function.LongSupplier` function for getting the nanoTime. In production code, this would default to `() -> System.nanoTime()`, but in tests, this could be used to mock the ""clock"" for getting nanoTime. Adding testability would cause some additional refactorings."

In this PR, we are more interested that the processing time gets properly recorded. That would have to be tested at a different level since JavaInstanceTest is at the level of the JavaInstance class. The processing time handling is in JavaInstanceRunnable. I think that tests for this PR should reside in JavaInstanceRunnable and possibly also in one of the end-to-end tests (for example `pulsar-broker/src/test/java/org/apache/pulsar/io/PulsarFunctionE2ETest.java`).

btw. One tip about assertions. For newly added tests, I'd recommend using [AssertJ fluent assertions](https://assertj.github.io/doc/) for more complex assertions. We have AssertJ already available as a test dependency in Pulsar. It's not that I'm saying that AssertJ must be used, it's just that if there are more complex assertions, it's a better option than TestNG's assertions. AssertJ assertions are easier to read and when there are failures, the error messages are really great."

Most likely you will first have to compile Pulsar on the command line with maven.
either

build core-modules:


```shell
 mvn -Pcore-modules,-main -T 1C clean install -DskipTests -Dspotbugs.skip=true
```

or build everything, skipping some checks to speed it up:

```shell
mvn -T 1C clean install -DskipTests -Dspotbugs.skip=true -Dcheckstyle.skip=true -Dlicense.skip=true

This change correctly casts the `value` column to `REAL` when the comparison argument is numeric. This is a good solution for enabling proper numeric comparisons on tags that are stored as text in JSON.

One aspect to consider is the behavior of `CAST(value AS REAL)` in SQLite when the `value` from the JSON tag is not a valid representation of a number (e.g., if a tag expected to be numeric accidentally contains text like ""N/A"" or ""Unknown""). SQLite typically converts such non-numeric strings to `0.0` during the cast.

For example:
*   If a tag `rate` has the string value `""abc""`, `CAST(value AS REAL)` for this tag would result in `0.0`.
*   A condition like `rate > 5` would then evaluate as `0.0 > 5` (false).
*   A condition like `rate = 0` would evaluate as `0.0 = 0` (true), which might be surprising if ""abc"" was not intended to be equivalent to zero.

Could this behavior lead to any unexpected results for users, particularly for equality checks against `0` or when tags might contain such non-parseable strings?

While this PR correctly implements the casting mechanism for intended numeric comparisons, it might be beneficial to consider if this side-effect needs documentation or if there are any scenarios where this could be problematic for users relying on smart playlists."
2542514135,2106254725,gemini-code-assist[bot],,,"![high](https://img.shields.io/badge/priority-high-orange)

The current implementation of casting `value` to `REAL` using `strings.ReplaceAll` applies broadly whenever a tag is marked as numeric. This means the cast will occur even if the specific database operation (`e.cond`) is string-based, such as `LIKE` (which would come from operators like `Contains`, `StartsWith`, `EndsWith`).

For example, if a user applies a `Contains` filter to a numeric tag (e.g., `rate contains '5'`), the condition `value LIKE ?` would become `CAST(value AS REAL) LIKE ?`. This could lead to unexpected query behavior or errors, as `LIKE` is fundamentally a string operation, and applying it after a numeric cast might not be what's intended or supported robustly.

To ensure correctness, should the cast to `REAL` be conditional, applying only when `e.cond` represents an operator that implies a numeric comparison (e.g., `=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`)? This would prevent the cast from interfering with legitimate string operations on the original string representation of the tag value.

What are your thoughts on refining this logic to be more operator-aware?

```suggestion
	if fm, ok := fieldMap[e.tag]; ok && fm.numeric {
		// Apply cast only for numeric-compatible operators
		isNumericCompatibleOp := false
		switch e.cond.(type) {
		case squirrel.Eq, squirrel.NotEq, squirrel.Gt, squirrel.Lt, squirrel.GtOrEq, squirrel.LtOrEq:
			isNumericCompatibleOp = true
		// default: isNumericCompatibleOp remains false, so string operations are not affected by the cast
		}

		if isNumericCompatibleOp {
			cond = strings.ReplaceAll(cond, ""value"", ""CAST(value AS REAL)"")
		}
	}
```"
2542514135,2106254726,gemini-code-assist[bot],,,"![medium](https://img.shields.io/badge/priority-medium-yellow)

The use of `CAST(%s AS REAL)` for sorting is specific to SQLite for handling floating-point numbers. This is perfectly fine if Navidrome intends to exclusively support SQLite or if this component is SQLite-specific.

However, if there's a possibility of supporting other SQL databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) in the future, this direct SQL syntax might pose a compatibility challenge. Other databases might use different type names (e.g., `FLOAT`, `DOUBLE PRECISION`, `NUMERIC`) or different casting syntax.

Is the intention for this part of the codebase to remain SQLite-centric, or might it be beneficial to consider a more database-agnostic approach to type casting for numeric fields in the long run? For now, with SQLite as the target, this is not an immediate issue but a point for future consideration."

Using `??` keeps falsy but defined values (e.g. `""""`) and satisfies the non-nullable contract.

like a user closes the plugin on the old version with some unsaved changes, and then opens and we have the new version out? with the current PR they'd not see their local changes and they'd pull. could we account for that?

i imagine something like.. in the absence of a fileKey (meaning they were still on the old version).. still read from the usual values property.

2470198455,2053458565,six7,,,"one other thing that i noticed just now:

the `checkForChanges` property.. we set that to `true` whenever we make changes. and then, when the user successfully pushed, we set it to `false` again.

we need to change this to `clientStorage` too. as in, if i make changes to a document, other people opening the file should not be shown that there's changes to recover (they wouldnt have access anyway).

i'd say try this out with 2 users:
1 makes changes, closes the plugin without pushing
the other opens the plugin. they should in that case not see the recover local changes dialog. 

if things already work like that, great - but i assume it would lead to some inconsistencies

in addition, i think.. we should do some garbage collection from time to time. like right now we dont ever `DELETE` those from client storage, meaning every time i do this in a new file, the data will pile up. 

can we make it so that we
- on successful push, reset the client storage property
- (specified in a comment further above), move the `checkForChanges` to client storage, and in the step where we're setting it to false also clean up the client storage?
- delete all client storage tokens except for the... 5 last saved ones? that feels like a number that means we always have enough storage left"

**Add content validation to match existing patterns**

The codebase shows a consistent pattern of validating both email metadata and content. Consider adding content validation to match this pattern, as seen in Email_settings_Spec.ts:

That info path isn’t covered by this branch, so later `ParseRawHeaderValues` will be called with `Parser == null` and throw. You should check `entry.Key.Parser is null` before casting to `HeaderStoreItemInfo` (or handle the `info` case) to yield raw values directly from the info instance.

`ParseRawHeaderValues` can handle cases without a parser just fine.

2622581875,2178008399,MihaZupan,,,"In general, no, since this is reachable from the public `Add(string name, IEnumerable<string> values)` API, so users are free to use any combination of add/add enumerable/add without validation/strongly typed properties.

Specifically when copying between collections, e.g.
```c#
foreach (var header in response.Headers)
{
    newHeaders.Add(header.Key, header.Value);
}
```
then yes, you'll only see one group of values per header name."
2622581875,2178046397,CarnaViire,,,"Will the change have any effect on how it worked before with the ""ungrouped"" values case? if I add multiple times ""some name + list with a single value"" -- that will all fit into this check -- will HeaderStoreItemInfo be skipped completely or will it still be created as soon as the second value is added?

I assume it doesn't matter that much because I'm not sure why this scenario could be ever needed, it's more that I'm just curious how it will behave"
2622581875,2178124828,MihaZupan,,,"How the storage in HttpHeaders works is that you effectively have a `Dictionary<string, object>`.

The value `object` can be either a `HeaderStoreItemInfo` or a `string`.
The `string` case is there to avoid allocations in the very common case where you have one value for a header, and it was added without validation. For example this is used for practically every header you'd see in `HttpResponseMessage.Headers`.

If the value was added with validation, or accessed with validation, or you have more than one value, the entry will be promoted to a `HeaderStoreItemInfo`.
`HeaderStoreItemInfo` has 2 `object` fields: `RawValue` and `ParsedAndInvalidValues`. These are going to be either one `string`/`object`, or a `List<string/object>`.

No matter how you add values (add, without validation, properties), they'll all follow the same rules.

What this PR changes is that it recognizes that values without a parser will never change, so it's using the optimization for the single non-validated value instead of allocating the info.
And in the reverse, if we already had just one non-validated value (e.g. you're accessing response headers), we can similarly avoid promoting the entry to a `HeaderStoreItemInfo` and return it as-is.

---

A valid implementation of `Add(string name, IEnumerable<string> values)` would be
```c#
public Add(string name, IEnumerable<string> values)
{
    foreach (string value in values)
        Add(name, value);
}
```
anything more than that are just optimizations (e.g. avoiding looking up the dictionary entry for every value).

So to answer the question, no, it shouldn't change the observable behavior.
`HeaderStoreItemInfo` will be created as soon as you add the second value, or even with the first one if that header has a parser."

2465883448,2048849885,tnyo43,,,"It simply copies the `relationship` objects to foreignKey constraint objects.

The Prisma schema has two [`relationMode`](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-schema/data-model/relations/relation-mode), ""foreignKeys"" (default) and ""prisma"". If it uses ""foreignKeys"" mode, it will handle relations in the database with foreign key constraints.
With ""prisma"" mode, the database doesn't handle the foreign key, but Prisma client emulates the foreign key constraints.

The ""prisma"" mode may not be appropriate for setting foreignKey constraints. However, I think we can start with simply accept all the relations as foreign key constraints and start re-considering when we find any inappropriate cases.

Here are the reasons why I gave up on implementing strict check for the `relationMode`:
- it looks impossible to get the `relationMode` value from `dmmf` object (from line 57), so it seems it requires parsing the data from `schemaString` by ourselves
- [Prisma recommends to use ""foreignKeys"" usually](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-schema/data-model/relations/relation-mode#handle-relations-in-your-relational-database-with-the-foreignkeys-relation-mode:~:text=Some%20databases%2C%20such,the%20preferred%20choice.)"

Thank you for your work on this PR! I really appreciate it.
I found one point I’d like to mention in this PR.

The `isAudioPlaybackEnabled` boolean value is used to distinguish between the AI’s audio mode and text-only mode. However, it seems that the user’s audio mode is also being turned off.

I think it would be better if the user’s audio mode remained available, regardless of the `isAudioPlaybackEnabled` setting.

Let me know what you think! 😊

```suggestion
    const sessionConfig = {
      modalities: [""text""],
      input_audio_format: ""pcm16"",
      input_audio_transcription: { model: ""whisper-1"" },
      instructions,
      tools,
      turn_detection: turnDetection,
    };
```

Summarizing the changes, the updated code would look like this:
```TypeScript
    const sessionConfig = {
      modalities: [""text""],
      input_audio_format: ""pcm16"",
      input_audio_transcription: { model: ""whisper-1"" },
      instructions,
      tools,
      turn_detection: turnDetection,
    };


    if (isAudioPlaybackEnabled) {
      sessionConfig.modalities.push(""audio""); // Changing this to ""text"" will disable audio
      Object.assign(sessionConfig, {
        voice: ""coral"",
        output_audio_format: ""pcm16"",
      });
    }

    const sessionUpdateEvent = {
      type: ""session.update"",
      session: sessionConfig,
    }
```"
2366413477,1976523607,AbrahamNobleOX,,,"If you mean that the agent doesn't listen, then I just tested again and it works really well.

The issue I think you may be having is that ""push to talk"" is checked, which is like a mute button and stops the agent from listening to your voice.

Make sure it is unchecked. See the attached image:

2366413477,1976525368,paix26875,,,"@AbrahamNobleOX 
Thanks for your response! I really appreciate the discussion.

What I meant to say is that `isAudioPlaybackEnabled` should be used only to control the AI's audio mode and should be independent of user audio input and Whisper transcription.

Also, Push to Talk isn’t actually a mute button—it controls turn detection. When enabled, the user’s voice is recognized only while the Talk button is pressed.

Your PR does provide more flexibility in toggling audio mode, which is great! However, I think that turning off `isAudioPlaybackEnabled` also disables Whisper transcription and turn detection based on the Push-to-Talk boolean value, which might not be the intended behavior.

Apologies if I misunderstood anything, and I’d love to hear your thoughts! 😊"

The `catch` block here is empty, meaning if `execAsync(command, ...)` fails for any reason (e.g., permission issues, unexpected output from a specific Python distribution's `--version` command, not just 'command not found'), the error is silently ignored, and the loop proceeds to the next candidate. While this allows the function to try other candidates, it can make debugging difficult if a Python installation that *should* be viable fails for an unexpected reason. The final error message thrown by `getOSPythonExecutable` is generic and won't provide clues about failures of intermediate candidates.

Could we consider logging the error encountered within this `catch` block, perhaps at a debug level? This would provide more insight during troubleshooting if Python detection fails unexpectedly for some users.

```typescript
      } catch (err) {
        // Optional: Log the error for debugging purposes, especially if it's not a 'command not found' type error.
        // logger.debug(`Candidate '${candidate}' failed: ${err instanceof Error ? err.message : String(err)}`);

**Incorrect String Comparison in Get Label Step.**  
The condition  
```bash
if ${LATEST} eq ""1.7""; then
```  
is not valid shell syntax. In Bash, you should use a bracketed expression for string comparison. For example:  
```diff
-          if ${LATEST} eq ""1.7""; then
+          if [ ""${LATEST}"" = ""1.7"" ]; then
```  
This change ensures the correct evaluation of the version string.

**Unresolved Merge Conflict Markers Detected.**  
There are merge conflict markers present in the check-format-diff job block. These markers cause YAML syntax errors (as flagged by static analysis) and must be resolved. It appears the intended changes from PR #2914 (removing the loadtest component) provide new commands that include additional targets and file checkouts. Please remove the conflict markers and retain the updated commands. For example:  
```diff
-<<<<<<< HEAD
-          make deps/install
-          make format
-          git checkout go.mod go.sum ./example/client/go.mod ./example/client/go.sum ./rust/Cargo.lock ./dockers
-========
-          make deps/install proto/replace license format format/go format/go/test
-          git checkout go.mod go.sum ./example/client/go.mod ./example/client/go.sum ./rust/Cargo.lock ./rust/rust-toolchain.toml ./dockers
->>>>>>> 47e25a547 (Remove loadtest component (#2914))
+          make deps/install proto/replace license format format/go format/go/test
+          git checkout go.mod go.sum ./example/client/go.mod ./example/client/go.sum ./rust/Cargo.lock ./rust/rust-toolchain.toml ./dockers
```  
This will resolve the syntax errors and ensure consistent behavior in the formatting step.

Is there a specific reason for committing this `changes.diff` file to the repository? 

Typically, diff files are used for review or patching but are not included as part of the project's source code. Version control systems like Git are designed to track changes between commits, making a committed diff file redundant and potentially confusing for future maintainers. 

Consider removing this file from the PR if it's not essential for the tool's runtime or build process."

It seems a backup file (`index.ts.backup`) has been included in this pull request. 

Version control systems like Git are designed to manage file history, making manual backup files within the repository unnecessary. These files can clutter the project and lead to confusion about which file is the current source of truth.

Could you please remove this backup file from the pull request?"

The AppleScript logic for retrieving the ChatGPT response in `askChatGPT` (and similarly in `getLastMessage`) has been simplified to return `item -1 of recentTexts`. This is a significant simplification from potentially more complex (and reportedly non-functional) previous methods.

While simplification is good, how robust is this approach? 
- Could `item -1 of recentTexts` inadvertently pick up a UI element that isn't part of the actual response (e.g., a 'Regenerate' button text, a timestamp, or other footer/status text if they are `AXStaticText` and appear last)?
- If a long response is split into multiple `AXStaticText` elements by ChatGPT's UI, this would only retrieve the very last piece.

The PR description mentions a ""High success rate across various response types."" It would be helpful to understand if these scenarios were tested and how this simplification holds up against them. If this approach is significantly more reliable than the previous one despite these potential edge cases, it's a pragmatic improvement. However, the potential for fragility should be noted."
2575521354,2133851951,gemini-code-assist[bot],,,"![medium](https://www.gstatic.com/codereviewagent/medium-priority.svg)

Similar to the `askChatGPT` function, the `getLastMessage` function's AppleScript relies on `item -1 of recentTexts` to fetch the message.

This carries the same potential concerns: 
- Could it pick up non-response UI elements if they are the last `AXStaticText`?
- If the last message is fragmented into multiple text elements, would this capture the complete message or just the final fragment?

Given this function's specific purpose is to get the *complete* last message, ensuring its robustness against these scenarios is important. The PR description mentions this function helps retrieve ""complete ChatGPT responses without resending prompts."" Confirming this completeness under various conditions would be valuable."

2458149257,2045421856,lucasgomide,,,"Something feels off here… I think your test might be too addicted, because it really shouldn’t work like, ever!
I believe you should be checking `hasattr(self.memory, ""llm"")` instead of `self`, since even self has a defined llm model.
What bothers me most is that even when one test fails, it still goes unnoticed that’s kind of serious.

If I’m right about this, it’d be a good idea to revisit the tests"
2458149257,2048309963,Dev-Khant,,,"Hey yes you are correct `hasattr(self, ""llm"")` was accessing the LLM from crewai and not from Mem0. And that;s why the tests also passed. But now I have made the fix for it."
2458149257,2048803309,lucasgomide,,,"@Dev-Khant Your added test still not testing what should be testing.
To ensure that I removed `hasattr(self.memory, ""llm"")` clause from `mem0_storage` and ran your added test, still passing. 

It is happens because you added test `test_search_with_llm` is mocking the `user_memory.storage`. 

Here's a few suggestions to fix it:

1. You have to cover mem0_storage, so add a test into `test_mem0_storage.py`
2. Add test to cover search and save methods 
3. Use `unittest.mock.patch` to mock the `memory.save` and `memory.search` calls. Example: `patch(""mem0.Memory.search"") as mock_method`
4. use `assert_called_once_with` to ensure the propagated parameters. Example: `mock_method.assert_called_once_with(agent_id=, metadata=, ...)`

2458149257,2049331836,Dev-Khant,,,Resolved.
2458149257,2051566888,lucasgomide,,,"qq, double checking.. 
If the memory does not support llm, you set `output_format`, right? But I noticed there’s another logic at line 121 in the search method over there, you’re doing: “if memory has llm, delete parameters”

That feels a bit confusing. Can you confirm if that’s expected behavior, or if we might need to align those two cases?

"
2458149257,2051571471,Vidit-Ostwal,,,"@lucasgomide, I think what's happening in here is a class comparision, whether the memory object belongs to Memory or Memory Client 
Basically MemoryClient does not have any llm attribute to it, so the first check is to make sure that if `self.memory` is not a MemoryClient class object, we need to have a parameter called `output_format`. and in the second case check I believe they are checking whether it's a object of Memory class, and if yes then we do not need this parameter. 

Bit confusing how `mem0` is configured. 
Still author can confirm more on this.

One suggestion from my side would be if I am right about class comparision, would be to that there are better way to check whether a object belongs to a particular class, like `isinstance`, I think better to use this for better code visibility. Lucas can surely add more context on this part."
2458149257,2054059128,lucasgomide,,,"@Vidit-Ostwal I also prefer class comparison, but even after changing it, the question remains… I’m asking because the test didn’t confirm that.
From reading this line, I expected that when running with Memory, the output_format shouldn’t be included in the `add()` parameters - but is not happing (on test at least)"

`output_format=""v1.1""` -> {""results"": <memories>} 
`output_format=""v1.0""` -> [<memories>]

We’ve now fully deprecated the `output_format` parameter from the OSS version, though it’s still in the process of being removed from the Platform. To maintain consistency in output format, I’ve added `output_format=""v1.1""` on line 92.

On line 121, there's a check to determine if the call is targeting OSS. If so, it removes the `output_format` parameter since it's deprecated in OSS but still required for the Platform or Mem0 client.

"
2458149257,2056808358,lucasgomide,,,"@Dev-Khant that is the point.. 

It's a bit tricky because in [your tests](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2604/files#diff-59f5e3e37e01e31b0274361fea3e2ad2db5934f78617704d4198b45d506a32fdR163)
both implementation are propagating `output_format`, but by reading your code it should be sent **ONLY** when the memory does not has `llm`. 
This is the last touchable point that isnot clear to me"

**Improve empty image fallback**

The current fallback for a missing image uses an empty source string, which could lead to broken image links or unexpected behavior in the UI.


```diff

If there's no suitable fallback image in the context, consider using a placeholder image or null handling in the template component.

This way the whole process will be split into small chunks where you handle just 1 entity, identify its dependencies and request them. This system will then collect all the entities and their dependencies. It is extensible and simple to maintain. It is reusable as it can be called from a command, UI controller, API controller or whatever will come in the future.

**Access modifier change from protected to public**

The visibility of `getExecutableOnLoadService` method has been changed from `protected` to `public`.

Consider whether this change is necessary. Protected methods are intended for use by subclasses only. If external classes need to access this method, verify that this doesn't break encapsulation principles or expose implementation details that should remain hidden.

**Revert `getExecutableOnLoadService` to protected unless external access is truly required**

The `getExecutableOnLoadService` method in  
`app/server/appsmith-server/src/main/java/com/appsmith/server/onload/internal/OnLoadExecutablesUtilCEImpl.java`  
was widened from `protected` to `public`, but all its invocations remain inside this class. Exposing it publicly risks breaking encapsulation without delivering any clear benefit.

• Location: OnLoadExecutablesUtilCEImpl.java, line ~1497  
• Usage: only called by other methods in the same class—no external references found

Suggested fix:
```diff
-    public ExecutableOnLoadService<?> getExecutableOnLoadService(CreatorContextType contextType) {
+    protected ExecutableOnLoadService<?> getExecutableOnLoadService(CreatorContextType contextType) {
```

Let’s assume the app is connected to Git and an action is set to run on page load (`ON_PAGE_LOAD` in the DB) with no diffs.

The `for range e.MaxRetryCount` syntax for iterating a specific number of times is a feature introduced in Go 1.22. If the project's minimum Go version is below 1.22, this change will result in a compilation error.

Please ensure that the project is targeting Go 1.22 or a newer version. If this is the case, the change is a good simplification, as the loop index `i` from the original loop (`for i := 0; i < e.MaxRetryCount; i++`) was not used within the loop body.

Please verify that the project's Go version supports this syntax. If Go 1.22+ is the target, this change is a modern and consistent way to write the loop, correctly preserving the index `i` which is used in this loop.

**Use NODE_NAME constant for consistency**

The progress reporting uses a hardcoded string `'executeDDL'` instead of the `NODE_NAME` constant defined at line 6. This creates inconsistency and potential maintenance issues.



```diff

Note: This assumes the `getWorkflowNodeProgress` function can handle the full node name. If it expects only the shortened version, consider updating the constants mapping or extracting a shorter identifier constant.

**Avoid suppressing Flow errors with $FlowFixMe hack.**

Using `// $FlowFixMe` to bypass type errors from the removed `ContentUploader` module is brittle and hides potential issues. Instead, consider one of the following:
1. Add a proper Flow libdef stub for the `content-uploader` module (e.g., in `flow-typed`) so imports resolve without suppressions.  
2. If this file is no longer intended to be Flow-typed, remove the `@flow` annotation and all Flow types from it.

The two `// $FlowFixMe` comments before importing `ContentUploaderPopup` and `WrappedContentUploaderComponent` hide Flow errors caused by the deleted `.js.flow` definitions. Instead:
- Create a stub declaration in `flow-typed` for the `content-uploader` paths, or

2588647144,2143787399,coderabbitai[bot],,,"@greg-in-a-box sure — here are two clean ways to get rid of the “`// $FlowFixMe`” band-aids.

────────────────────────
Option 1 – keep Flow, add proper stubs  
────────────────────────
1. Create a stub file under `flow-typed/stubs` (any folder under `flow-typed` is fine).  
   Example path: `flow-typed/stubs/content-uploader.js`.

2. Add module declarations that match the import strings Flow sees (absolute-from-project-root, no “.js”):

```js
// flow-typed/stubs/content-uploader.js
declare module 'src/elements/content-uploader/ContentUploader' {
  declare module.exports: React$ComponentType<any>;
}

declare module 'src/elements/content-uploader/ContentUploaderPopup' {
  declare module.exports: React$ComponentType<any>;
}
```

3. Delete the two `// $FlowFixMe` lines in `src/elements/wrappers/ContentUploader.js`.  
   Flow will now pick up the stub definitions and stop complaining.

Why this works  
• Flow looks for “library definitions” before falling back to source; any module string that can’t be resolved gets satisfied by a libdef.  
• Putting them in `flow-typed/` keeps them out of your compiled bundle and groups all stubs in one place.  
• Using `React$ComponentType<any>` preserves the fact that they’re React components while still being permissive.

────────────────────────
Option 2 – drop Flow from this wrapper entirely  
────────────────────────
If the rest of the file is now plain JS/TypeScript, you can simply remove Flow from this wrapper:

1. Delete the header:
```diff
- /**
-  * @flow
-  * @file Base class …
-  */
```

2. Remove Flow-specific type imports:
```diff
-import type { UploadFileWithAPIOptions } from '../../common/types/upload';
-import type { BoxItem } from '../../common/types/core';
-import type { ModalOptions } from '../common/flowTypes';
```

3. Strip the inline annotations and casts. E.g.:

```diff
- onComplete = (data: BoxItem[]): void => {
+ onComplete = data => {
    this.emit('complete', data);
  };

- render() {
+ render() {
     const { modal, ...rest } = this.options;
     …
-    modal={((modal: any): ModalOptions)}
+    modal={modal}
```

4. Save, run `flow` — the file is now invisible to Flow, so the suppressions are no longer needed.

Choose whichever path fits your codebase direction:

• If you’re keeping Flow elsewhere, Option 1 maintains type safety.  
• If the long-term goal is to phase Flow out, Option 2 is simpler.

Let me know if you’d like a sample diff or need help tweaking either approach!

**Kernel argument order changed – verify Metal shader expects the extra offset**

`set_params!(encoder, ((input, input_offset), …))` passes a 2-tuple where the kernel previously received a single `device uint*` buffer.  
Please double-check that:

* the corresponding Metal kernel signature was updated to
  `device uint* input[[buffer(0)]], uint input_offset[[buffer(1)]]` (or similar);  
* buffer indices of all subsequent parameters were shifted by **+1**;  
* all earlier kernels that rely on this utility macro were re-compiled, otherwise they will receive mis-aligned arguments at runtime and crash.

**Update Metal kernels to accept `input_offset` as a separate buffer**

I scanned all `.metal` shaders under `mistralrs-quant/src/metal_kernels` and found no `input_offset` in any kernel declarations. Since `set_params!(encoder, ((input, input_offset), …))` now passes two buffers, the shaders must be updated to match:

• In each kernel (e.g. `blockwise_fp8.metal`, `bnb_dequantize.metal`, `hqq_dequantize.metal`, `quantized.metal`, etc.), change the signature from  
  ```metal
  kernel void foo(device const <T>* input [[buffer(0)]],
                  device const <U>* scales[[buffer(1)]], …
  )
  ```
  to  
  ```metal
  kernel void foo(device const <T>* input        [[buffer(0)]],
                  uint            input_offset     [[buffer(1)]],
                  device const <U>* scales       [[buffer(2)]],

                  device <R>*       output       [[buffer(4)]]) { … }
  ```

• Shift all subsequent `[[buffer(N)]]` indices by **+1**.

• Recompile every affected kernel to ensure buffer indices remain aligned at runtime.

**`loading_isq` forced to `false` – risk of high-memory loads**

Resetting `loading_isq` immediately after calling `set_immediate_isq` means the loader will:

1. keep loading tensors on the *final* device (often the GPU) instead of the CPU,
2. skip the streaming/CPU-first path that was designed to avoid OOM when the model is larger than available VRAM / RAM.

If the intent is “quantize *while* loading”, the un-quantised tensor will still briefly occupy full precision memory on the target device before `apply_isq` runs in the layer constructor, defeating the PR’s memory-saving goal on GPUs with tight budgets.

Please re-evaluate:

```diff
-            loading_isq = false;
+            // Keep true so that VarBuilder loads to CPU, saving device memory
+            // Quantization will migrate the final weight to the intended device.
```

At minimum, add a comment describing why the flag is deliberately cleared.

---

🏁 Script executed:

```shell
#!/bin/bash
# Search for all occurrences of `loading_isq` in the codebase

**Clarify the reset of `loading_isq` after immediate quantization**

The call to `mistralrs_quant::set_immediate_isq(in_situ_quant)` configures in-situ quantization for the next load, but the very next line force-clears `loading_isq`, which means all subsequent tensors will load at full precision on the final device (often the GPU), skipping the CPU-first streaming path and increasing OOM risk. Please choose one of the following:

- Remove the `loading_isq = false;` so that the CPU-first path remains active for all layers.  
- Or keep the reset but add a clear comment explaining why immediate quantization alone is sufficient here and why streaming is deferred to later logic.

Locations needing attention:

- `mistralrs-core/src/pipeline/normal.rs:470–472`

**In-place ISQ applied, but first constructs an unused layer – avoid double allocation**

`let mut this: Arc<dyn QuantMethod> = Arc::new(Self { … });`  
immediately followed by `this = this.clone().apply_isq(…)` allocates *two* `RowParallelLayer` instances (one un-quantised, one quantised).  
For very large matrices this briefly doubles memory usage and adds an unnecessary copy.

You can skip the first allocation by directly wrapping the quantised weight:

```diff
- let mut this: Arc<dyn QuantMethod> = Arc::new(Self { … });
- if let Some(immediate_isq) = get_immediate_isq() {
-     this = this.clone().apply_isq(...)?;
- }
+ let this_unquant = Arc::new(Self { … });
+ let this: Arc<dyn QuantMethod> = if let Some(isq) = get_immediate_isq() {
+     this_unquant.clone().apply_isq(Some(isq), vb.device().clone(),
+                                    &AtomicUsize::new(0), None, QuantizeOntoGuard::new())?
+ } else {
+     this_unquant
+ };
```

The same pattern appears in `ColumnParallelLayer`, `ReplicatedLayer`, and `PackedExperts` – worth factoring into a small helper to avoid code duplication.

**`NiceProgressBar::<_, 'b'>(` is ill-formed and will not compile**

A lifetime parameter (`'b`) cannot be introduced out of thin air in a turbofish; Rust will complain with  
`error[E0261]: use of undeclared lifetime name 'b`.

Unless the struct really needs an explicit lifetime *and* you already have such a lifetime in scope, the
simplest fix is to drop the turbofish altogether and rely on type inference:

<summary>🧩 Analysis chain</summary>

**Parallel layer construction is great – please double-check that the resulting `Vec` keeps layer order.**

`rayon::ParallelIterator::collect::<Vec<_>>()` preserves order only when the iterator implements `IndexedParallelIterator`.  
`NiceProgressBar` wraps the range and implements `IntoParallelIterator`, but it is not obvious at a glance whether its parallel iterator is still *indexed* (and therefore ordered) or merely *unindexed*.  
If ordering is lost, layers could be shuffled, breaking cache indexing and any code that relies on `layers[i]` being “layer *i*”.


Please run a quick sanity-check that the i-th element of `layers` has `layer_idx == i` after construction, e.g.:

```rust
for (i, l) in layers.iter().enumerate() {
    assert!(l.cache_index() == i, ""layer order mismatch"");
}
```

If ordering is not guaranteed, one safe pattern is:

```diff
- .into_par_iter()
- .map(|layer_idx| { /* build DecoderLayer */ })
- .collect::<Result<Vec<_>>>()?;
+ use rayon::iter::IndexedParallelIterator; // ensure trait in scope
+ let mut layers: Vec<(usize, DecoderLayer)> = NiceProgressBar::<_, 'b'>(...)
+     .into_par_iter()
+     .map(|layer_idx| Ok((layer_idx, build_layer(layer_idx)?)))
+     .collect::<Result<Vec<_>>>()?;
+ layers.sort_by_key(|(idx, _)| *idx);
+ let layers = layers.into_iter().map(|(_, l)| l).collect();
```

**Ensure layer order when collecting in parallel**

The `NiceProgressBar::into_par_iter` returns a `ParProgress<I>` that only implements `ParallelIterator` (not `IndexedParallelIterator`), so `collect::<Vec<_>>()` does *not* guarantee preserving the original index order. Relying on `layers[i]` to correspond to `layer_idx == i` can lead to subtle bugs.

To fix, capture each layer’s index, then sort before stripping the index:

```diff
- let layers: Vec<DecoderLayer> = NiceProgressBar::<_, 'b'>(
-     0..cfg.num_hidden_layers,
-     ""Loading repeating layers"",
-     &normal_loading_metadata.multi_progress,
- )
- .into_par_iter()
- .map(|layer_idx| build_layer(layer_idx))
- .collect::<Result<_, _>>()?;
+ // Pair each layer with its index, collect in any order, then sort back into sequence
+ let mut layers_with_idx: Vec<(usize, DecoderLayer)> = NiceProgressBar::<_, 'b'>(
+     0..cfg.num_hidden_layers,
+     ""Loading repeating layers"",
+     &normal_loading_metadata.multi_progress,
+ )
+ .into_par_iter()
+ .map(|layer_idx| Ok((layer_idx, build_layer(layer_idx)?)))
+ .collect::<Result<_, _>>()?;
+ layers_with_idx.sort_unstable_by_key(|(idx, _)| *idx);
+ let layers: Vec<DecoderLayer> = layers_with_idx
+     .into_iter()
+     .map(|(_, layer)| layer)
+     .collect();
```

• This guarantees `layers[i]` is always the layer constructed from `layer_idx == i`.  
• Alternatively, implement `IndexedParallelIterator` for `ParProgress<I>` if you need true ordered parallel collection.

**Convert `.expect()` calls to `?` to maintain fallible semantics and prevent runtime panics**

`PagedAttention::new` and `mapper.get_comm_for` can legitimately fail (allocation issues, invalid config, etc.).  
Using `expect` will panic inside a Rayon worker thread, bringing the whole model load down without a clean error message.

```diff
- AttentionImplementation::PagedAttention => Some(
-     PagedAttention::new(head_dim, device, None)
-         .expect(""PagedAttention creation failed""),
- ),
+ AttentionImplementation::PagedAttention => {
+     Some(PagedAttention::new(head_dim, device, None)?)
+ },

- let comm = mapper
-     .get_comm_for(layer_idx)
-     .expect(""Failed to get comm for layer"");
+ let comm = mapper.get_comm_for(layer_idx)?;
```

This keeps the nice `Result<Vec<DecoderLayer>>` collection and surfaces the real error to callers instead of crashing.

**Fix hash value handling to ensure proper message deduplication.**

There's a critical issue in the hash handling that could cause the deduplication logic to fail. When adding a hash to the cache, you're recalculating it by calling `hasher.finish()` again, which will produce a different hash value than what was checked.

Apply this fix:

```diff
pub fn once_log_info<M: AsRef<str>>(msg: M) {
    let msg = msg.as_ref();
    let mut hasher = DefaultHasher::new();
    msg.hash(&mut hasher);

    if !log.contains(&hash) {
        info!(""{msg}"");

    } else {
-       log.push(hasher.finish());

**Heavy duplication of literal regex strings – extract a helper**

Eight almost-identical patterns are repeated across many loaders (only the prefix differs).  
Duplications make maintenance error-prone (a future change must be replicated N times).

A minimal helper could be:

```rust
fn llama_family_regexes(prefix: &str) -> Vec<Regex> {
    [""q_proj"", ""k_proj"", ""v_proj"", ""o_proj""]
        .into_iter()
        .map(|proj| Regex::new(&format!(r""{prefix}\.self_attn\.{proj}\.(weight|bias)$"")).unwrap())
        .collect()
}
```

…then invoked here with  
`llama_family_regexes(r""model\.text_model\.layers\.(\d+)"")` plus the `lm_head` & MLP extras.

This keeps the list in one place and guarantees consistency.

**Verify function signature compatibility.**

The change passes the entire `response` object to `split_and_parse_json_objects` instead of just the content string (`response.choices[0].message.content`). Please verify that the `split_and_parse_json_objects` function signature has been updated to handle response objects.


Run the following script to verify the function signature and usage:

---

🏁 Script executed:

```shell
#!/bin/bash
# Description: Check the split_and_parse_json_objects function signature and its usage

# Search for the function definition

**Mismatch in split_and_parse_json_objects argument – needs the content string, not the full response object**

The helper `split_and_parse_json_objects` is defined as:
```python
def split_and_parse_json_objects(json_string: str) -> tuple[list, list]:
    ...
```
but in `crawl4ai/extraction_strategy.py` you’re now passing the entire `response` object. This will raise a type error at runtime.

Please update the call at line ~683 in `crawl4ai/extraction_strategy.py`:

```diff
- parsed, unparsed = split_and_parse_json_objects(
-     response
- )
+ parsed, unparsed = split_and_parse_json_objects(
+     response.choices[0].message.content
+ )
```

This ensures you pass the expected JSON string payload.

The `is not None` check is useful in scenarios where there's a considerable difference between None, zero, an empty string, or any other ""falsey"" values. In Python, zero (0), an empty string(""""), an empty list ([]), etc., are all considered ""falsey"" values (which means they'll evaluate to False in a boolean context). None is also a ""falsey"" value.

If `_ArtifactPathFinder.parse(p)` is able to possibly return 0 (or any other ""falsey"" value that is not None), and considering `0` is a valid output you want to catch, the `is not None` is necessary because `if idx := _ArtifactPathFinder.parse(p):` would evaluate to False if `idx` is 0, skipping the body of the conditional, whereas `if (idx := _ArtifactPathFinder.parse(p)) is not None:` will go into the `if` block even if `idx` is 0. 

Without the `is not None`, any ""falsey"" value would be akin to None, which might not be the intended behavior.

The inclusion patterns have been narrowed to specific Next.js file types. While this aligns with the onboarding file removals and may improve build performance, ensure that other necessary `.ts` and `.tsx` files (like components, utilities, etc.) are still being compiled if they exist outside these patterns.

**Expand `tsconfig.json` include patterns to cover all source files**

The current setup only includes Next.js route files (`page.tsx`, `error.tsx`, `not-found.tsx`, `layout.tsx`, `route.ts`). We’ve identified several `.ts`/`.tsx` files that fall outside these patterns and won’t be compiled:

• frontend/app/administrator/settings/QuickbooksIntegration.tsx  
• frontend/app/companies/[companyId]/investor/onboarding/index.ts  
• frontend/app/companies/[companyId]/worker/onboarding/index.ts  
• …plus any other components or utilities under `app/`  

To fix this, update `frontend/tsconfig.json`—for example:

```diff
   ""include"": [
-    ""app/**/page.tsx"",
-    ""app/**/error.tsx"",
-    ""app/**/not-found.tsx"",
-    ""app/**/layout.tsx"",
-    ""app/**/route.ts"",
+    ""app/**/*.ts"",
+    ""app/**/*.tsx"",
+    // preserve any other patterns you need
   ],
```

Once updated, verify by running your e2e tests (e.g. `pnpm playwright test frontend/e2e/...`) to ensure no files are missing from compilation.

**Fix TypeScript error with icon property types**

There's a type mismatch error in the pipeline. The onPress handlers in popupMenu items don't accept a close parameter, unlike the existing items.


Fix the issue by updating the onPress handlers in popupMenu to match the existing pattern:

```diff
- onPress: async () => {
+ onPress: async (close: () => void) => {
+   close();
    defaultLogger.account.wallet.openSidePanel();
    await extUtils.openPanelOnActionClick(true);
    await extUtils.openSidePanel(routeInfo);
    window.close();
  },
```

Make the same change to all other onPress handlers in the popupMenu items.

**Watch for TypeScript mismatch in the onPress callback.**

The `onPress` handlers in `popupMenu` do not accept the `(close: () => void)` parameter, unlike other items. This might cause pipeline or runtime issues if `ActionList` expects the same function signature for all onPress handlers.

Please refactor them to match the `onPress: async (close: () => void) => { ... }` pattern if needed.

Ah I see, in this case [`to_hash`](https://edgeapi.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionController/Parameters.html#method-i-to_hash) instead `to_h` will help.

Nope, that's not necessary because we are already using booleans in the JSON payload.

The reason you're seeing the string `""true""`/`""false""` in the error is because of how the endpoint is invoked in the tests:

```ruby
post :export, params: { options: options }
```

should really be

post :export, params: { options: options }, as: :json

**Add Biome linting for packages/api in CI**  
The CI workflow currently doesn’t include `packages/api` in its lint step (your verification script echoed an error). Please update `.github/workflows/ci.yml` so that Biome runs against this package.

Suggested changes:  
- In `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, locate the lint job and add `packages/api` to the paths or directory list.  
- For example, if you’re invoking Biome with explicit package paths:  
  ```diff
  jobs:
    lint:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v3
  -     - run: biome check packages/core packages/utils
  +     - run: biome check packages/core packages/utils packages/api
  ```
- Or, if you’re using a glob/pattern, ensure it matches `packages/api/**`.

Is there a way to not have a wrapper like this and instead have it setup within tools. Ideal implementation would look like this for me, and something that would live on the tools repo vs the core lib:

WDYT of this:
```python
mcp_tool = MCPServerToolAdapter(server_parameters={...})
agent = Agent(
        role=""Research Agent"",
        goal=""Find studies about hangover"",
        backstory=""You help find studies about hangover"",
        verbose=True,
        tools=[mcp_tool],
    )
```

I started this: but agents struggling to pass the arguments properly. If you can help bring your implementation over 🙏🏼 
https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-tools/tree/feat/mcp-server-tools-adapter
"
2426802205,2023499997,grll,,,"I don't see your implementation there did you push it? 
It's definitely possible to make it more as above with a few caveats: here I suggested to use a context manager because unlike other kind of tool that I have seen in the repo attached, we need to manage the lifecycle of the mcp server so when you start the context manager you actually spawn the mcp server in the background in a subprocess. When you reach the end of your agentic pipeline you want to cleanly kill the subprocess / mcp server so contextmanager really fit that idea here. That being said, it's also possible to do it as you did but then users would need to not forget to somehow close / kill the mcp server process after the agent has run."
2426802205,2023502375,grll,,,"and yes I also know the struggle with the arguments, you need to make sure the documentation from the mcp which is json schema correctly pipe through up until the LLM prompt :)"
2426802205,2025178469,lorenzejay,,,we can spin up and then close when the tool call is complete. would that work ?
2426802205,2025179790,lorenzejay,,,wondering if there is a more elegant DX wbhere we manage that from the tools side 
2426802205,2025254810,grll,,,yes that would also work with a .start() / .close() pattern but that's a bit why contextmanager were invented in the first place to not forget the .close(). Or do you mean using the agent lifecycle for it?
2508388895,2081020761,Vidit-Ostwal,,,"Hi Lucas, I think 
```python
aggregate_raw_outputs_from_tasks(task.context)
if task.context is EMPTY
else aggregate_raw_outputs_from_task_outputs(task_outputs)

this should be revered, if text.context is EMPTY, user wants to take all the previous task input.

2508388895,2081980066,mikhail,,,Could be even more explicit as NOT_SPECIFIED or NOT_USER_DEFINED to really drive the point home. Pydantic has something similar - `PydanticUndefined`
2508388895,2082783694,mikhail,,,"on a second thought even the default should be explicit. Meaning all the possible values should be not just a boolean but:

1) ""inherit_all""
2) ""inherit_last""
3) List[Tasks]
4) None (or empty list)

And then set the default to ""inherit_all"". That way you're avoiding having this magic constant altogether, and if you change the behavior later it will be again very explicit and straightforward."

**Add nil safety validation for bank account access.**

This code follows the same refactor pattern as other classes, but lacks the `bank_account_ready?` validation that exists in `ChargeConsolidatedInvoice`. Consider adding similar validation to prevent potential nil pointer exceptions.



Add validation before accessing the bank account:

```diff
 def create_payment_intent
   company = Company.is_gumroad.sole
+  raise ""Company does not have a bank account set up"" unless company.bank_account_ready?
   stripe_setup_intent = company.bank_account.stripe_setup_intent

In backend/app/sidekiq/stripe_balance_top_up_job.rb around lines 40 to 41, add a
nil safety check before accessing company.bank_account by verifying if the bank
account is ready, similar to the bank_account_ready? validation used in
ChargeConsolidatedInvoice. This prevents potential nil pointer exceptions by
ensuring the bank account exists and is accessible before calling
stripe_setup_intent.

**Nitpick:** The declaration `@@unique([id])` is redundant because the `id` field is already marked as the primary key and is inherently unique. Additionally, consider adding an index for `frameworkId` (e.g., `@@index([frameworkId])`) if you anticipate frequent queries filtering by framework.

**Speed swap hooks initialized but not used.**

The component initializes speed swap hooks and destructures their values, but doesn't use them in the UI. Are these hooks intended for future implementation or should they connect to existing UI elements?

Also, consider whether hardcoded values `'evm--1'` and empty `accountId` are appropriate or should come from props or context.

**Unused speed-swap hooks in SwapPanel.tsx**

The hooks return values and actions that aren’t used in the JSX. Either wire them up or remove them. Also, replace hard-coded network and empty accountId.

• SwapPanel.tsx (lines 32–33): you destructure `isLoading`, `speedConfig`, `supportSpeedSwap`, `provider` from `useSpeedSwapInit` but never use them.  
• SwapPanel.tsx (lines 36–43): you pull in `speedSwapBuildTx`, `speedSwapBuildTxLoading`, `cancelSpeedSwapBuildTx`, `handleSpeedSwapBuildTxSuccess` from `useSpeedSwapActions` but don’t connect them to any UI (e.g., `<ActionButton>`).  
• Drop these hooks until you need them, or wire their outputs into your components.  
• Don’t hard-code `networkId: 'evm--1'` and `accountId: ''`; get those values from props or context.

their returned values and actions are not used in the JSX, and the networkId and

The newly added FormSectionStyle component directly accesses state.theme.section without checking if it exists.


Add null checking to prevent potential runtime errors:

```diff
function FormSectionStyle({
  className,
  children,
}: React.PropsWithChildren<{
  className?: string;
}>) {
  const [state] = useEditorState();
-  const sectioncss = state.theme.section;
+  const sectionCss = state.theme?.section || '';

-  return <section className={cn(sectioncss, className)}>{children}</section>;
+  return <section className={cn(sectionCss, className)}>{children}</section>;
}
```

**Avoid direct DOM manipulation in React components**

Using `document.createElement` directly in a component can cause issues with server-side rendering. Move this logic into a useEffect hook or use a client-side only component.


```diff
  const descriptionPlainText = useMemo(() => {
+    if (typeof document === 'undefined') return '';
    const el = document.createElement(""div"");
    el.innerHTML = description;
    return el.textContent || """";
  }, [description]);
```

Alternatively, consider using a DOM-less HTML parser library like `html-to-text` for a more robust solution.

**Add missing functionality to ThemeSelect component**

The `ThemeSelect` component renders a button that appears to be selectable but doesn't have any onClick handler or actual theme selection functionality implemented.


Either implement the theme selection functionality or replace with a non-interactive component if this is just a preview:

```diff
-function ThemeSelect({ className }: { className?: string }) {
+function ThemeSelect({ 
+  className,
+  onChange
+}: { 
+  className?: string,
+  onChange?: (theme: string) => void
+}) {
  return (
    <button
      className={cn(
        ""h-14 text-left rounded-md p-2 border border-input flex justify-between gap-2"",
        className
      )}
+     onClick={() => onChange?.('solid')}
    >
```

Then update the usage in the parent component to handle theme changes:
```diff
-                <ThemeSelect className=""flex-1"" />
+                <ThemeSelect 
+                  className=""flex-1"" 
+                  onChange={(themeType) => setTheme({...theme, background: { type: themeType }})} 
+                />

* `ThreeOptLayout::Run`: Set up some data structures, run 3-opt, and reorder the block list
* `ThreeOptLayout::RunThreeOpt`: Run a 3-opt pass, and evaluate the new layout cost. TODO: If we want to try searching for a better local optimum, run another 3-opt pass with a different initial layout. I'd be surprised if this second pass makes a difference when we don't have loops, so a decent starting heuristic is to run another pass only when we have them. My current plan is to first run 3-opt without `fgMoveHotJumps` run on the initial layout, and then if we have loops, run `fgMoveHotJumps` on the initial layout, and try 3-opt again. We'll keep the better of the two.

**Handlers exported but not registered**

`LearnFromUsageHandler`, `GetPersonalizedSuggestionsHandler`, and `OptimizeForAiPatternsHandler` are re-exported but **never instanced** inside `setupAdaptiveLearningTools()`.  
Either:

1. return their metadata straight from static properties on each handler, or  
2. instantiate them and call `getDefinition()` to keep a single source of truth.

Right now you maintain two parallel definitions—easy to let them drift.

**Global name collision not guarded**  
Nothing prevents two different categories from listing the same integration (e.g. `xml-parser` appears in *Data & Storage* and *Miscellaneous*). The push at 624–643 will happily create duplicate `name` fields, breaking any map/dictionary keyed by node name later (see `NodeDiscoveryService` which stores them in a `Map`).

**Duplicate-name risk across categories**  
`coreNodeNames` are normalised by stripping the `n8n-nodes-base.` prefix, while the `integration` strings in most categories contain dashes (e.g. `http-request`). This means a core node such as `httpRequest` will not collide with `http-request`, so both will be pushed into the array, creating two nodes with *logically* identical meaning but different names.  Down-stream consumers that key off the dashed version only will see duplicates or miss the core node.

Consider normalising **both** sides (lower-case, strip prefix, remove dashes/underscores) or maintaining a `Set` of already-emitted full node names to guarantee global uniqueness during the loop.

**Explain URL parsing before route matching**

The implementation uses PHP’s `parse_url(..., PHP_URL_PATH)` to strip off the domain and pass only the path (e.g. `/resource/new`) to the URL matcher. Adding a brief comment (or extracting to a `$path` variable) will make this intent explicit and align the test expectation with the code.

**Potential issue with mock expectations for success notification test.**

There's an inconsistency in the test logic. Line 52 sets up an expectation that `hasClass` will never be called on the first message, but then expects it to return `true`. This is contradictory.



```diff
-        $firstMessage->expects($this->never())->method('hasClass')->with('alert-success')->willReturn(true);

The `willReturn(true)` should be removed since the method is never expected to be called.

In src/Sylius/Behat/tests/Service/NotificationCheckerTest.php between lines 43
and 57, the test incorrectly sets an expectation on the first message's hasClass
method to never be called but also specifies it should return true, which is
contradictory. To fix this, remove the willReturn(true) part from the
firstMessage's hasClass expectation on line 52, so it only asserts the method is

**Strong test design with systematic assertion issues to fix.**

Overall, this test class provides comprehensive coverage of SessionManager functionality with sophisticated mocking. The systematic assertion syntax issues need to be addressed, but the underlying test logic and approach are sound.



After fixing the assertion issues, consider extracting the callback logic into private helper methods to improve readability and reduce duplication across the test methods.

**Fix assertion syntax and good use of match expressions.**

The test effectively uses modern PHP match expressions for callback logic, but has assertion syntax issues.



Lines 169 and 173 have the same assertion problems:

```diff
-                    $this->assertSame($key, 'behat_previous_session_name', 'default_session');

+                    $this->assertSame('behat_previous_session_token_default_session', $key);
```



The use of `match` expressions in the callbacks (lines 143-147, 155-159) is a modern and clean approach for handling multiple return values based on input parameters.

**Consider enhancing test coverage for sorting functionality.**

The current test only verifies that the API accepts the `sort` parameter without error, but doesn't validate the actual sorting behavior. For comprehensive testing of this new feature, consider adding assertions to verify:

- The response data is actually sorted by date in ascending order
- Different sort parameters work correctly (e.g., ""id:desc"", ""date:desc"")
- Error handling for invalid sort parameters



Example enhancement:
```diff
When(""paginating on date"", func() {
	It(""should be ok"", func(specContext SpecContext) {
-		_, err := Wait(specContext, DeferClient(testServer)).Ledger.V2.ListLogs(
+		response, err := Wait(specContext, DeferClient(testServer)).Ledger.V2.ListLogs(
			ctx,
			operations.V2ListLogsRequest{
				Ledger: ""default"",
				Sort:   pointer.For(""date:asc""),
			},
		)
		Expect(err).ToNot(HaveOccurred())
+		
+		// Verify logs are sorted by date in ascending order
+		logs := response.V2LogsCursorResponse.Cursor.Data
+		for i := 1; i < len(logs); i++ {
+			Expect(logs[i].Date.After(logs[i-1].Date) || logs[i].Date.Equal(logs[i-1].Date)).To(BeTrue())

**Add error handling for polling timeout and consider user feedback.**

The polling logic correctly addresses the race condition between setting claim conditions and minting. However, consider these improvements:

1. **Error handling**: The current implementation doesn't handle the timeout scenario explicitly
2. **User feedback**: Users won't know why minting is delayed during the polling period
3. **Timeout duration**: The 30-second timeout should be documented or configurable



```diff
 // poll until claim conditions are set before moving on to minting
+try {
   await pollWithTimeout({
     shouldStop: async () => {
       const claimConditions = await getActiveClaimCondition({
         contract,
       });
       return !!claimConditions;
     },
     timeoutMs: 30000,
   });
+} catch (error) {
+  throw new Error(""Timeout waiting for claim conditions to be set. Please try again."");

@MananTank You're absolutely right! I apologize for the oversight in my suggestion. If `pollWithTimeout` already throws an error on timeout, then the additional try-catch block I suggested would indeed be redundant.

The other suggestions about user feedback during polling and documenting the 30-second timeout rationale might still be worth considering for improved UX, but the error handling aspect of my review was incorrect.

@MananTank You're absolutely right! Looking at the `pollWithTimeout` implementation and how it's used elsewhere in the codebase (wrapped with `tryCatch` in billing components), it's clear that the function already throws errors on timeout. My suggestion about adding error handling was completely redundant.

Thank you for the correction. The polling logic you've implemented will properly throw an error if the 30-second timeout is reached before claim conditions are set, which is exactly the behavior needed here.

The other aspects of my original suggestion (user feedback during polling and timeout documentation) might still be worth considering, but you're spot on about the error handling being unnecessary.

---

#### Snippet: `pollWithTimeout` import and usage in `mintTokens` function (lines ~130-160)

- The `pollWithTimeout` function is imported from `utils/pollWithTimeout`.
- It is used in the `mintTokens` function to poll until claim conditions are set before proceeding with minting tokens.
- The call:
  ```ts
  await pollWithTimeout({
    shouldStop: async () => {
      const claimConditions = await getActiveClaimCondition({ contract });
      return !!claimConditions;
    },
    timeoutMs: 30000,
  });
  ```
- This indicates `pollWithTimeout` is expected to throw an error if the timeout expires before `shouldStop` returns true.

@MananTank You're absolutely right! I apologize for the oversight in my suggestion. If `pollWithTimeout` already throws an error on timeout, then the additional try-catch block I suggested would indeed be redundant.

The other suggestions about user feedback during polling and documenting the 30-second timeout rationale might still be worth considering for improved UX, but the error handling aspect of my review was incorrect.

@MananTank You're absolutely right! Looking at the `pollWithTimeout` implementation and how it's used elsewhere in the codebase (wrapped with `tryCatch` in billing components), it's clear that the function already throws errors on timeout. My suggestion about adding error handling was completely redundant.

Thank you for the correction. The polling logic you've implemented will properly throw an error if the 30-second timeout is reached before claim conditions are set, which is exactly the behavior needed here.

The other aspects of my original suggestion (user feedback during polling and timeout documentation) might still be worth considering, but you're spot on about the error handling being unnecessary.

#### Snippet: `pollWithTimeout` import and usage in `mintTokens` function (lines ~130-160)

- The `pollWithTimeout` function is imported from `utils/pollWithTimeout`.
- It is used in the `mintTokens` function to poll until claim conditions are set before proceeding with minting tokens.
- The call:
  ```ts
  await pollWithTimeout({
    shouldStop: async () => {
      const claimConditions = await getActiveClaimCondition({ contract });
      return !!claimConditions;
    },
    timeoutMs: 30000,
  });
  ```
- This indicates `pollWithTimeout` is expected to throw an error if the timeout expires before `shouldStop` returns true.

2271360072,1914242514,mxxk,,,"Interesting, thanks for flagging. Taking a closer look at `dotenv`'s subpath exports`, I see a couple of differences:

#### 1. The `dotenv` entrypoint has a separate `require` condition which points to the same file as `default`

```json
""."": {
  ""types"": ""./lib/main.d.ts"",
  ""require"": ""./lib/main.js"",
  ""default"": ""./lib/main.js""
}
```

From what I know of how these work, the `require` condition is not needed, since it points to the same file as `default`, and `default` is a catch-all, so the following would still work:

```diff
 ""."": {
   ""types"": ""./lib/main.d.ts"",
-  ""require"": ""./lib/main.js"",
   ""default"": ""./lib/main.js""
 }
```

#### 2. The `dotenv/config` entrypoint is missing `types`

```json
""./config"": ""./config.js""
```

Looks like this is okay because

1. `dotenv/config` is meant to be imported for its side-effects only,

    ```js
    // ESM
    import 'dotenv/config';
    
    // CJS
    require('dotenv/config');
    ```
    
    so TypeScript does not need to look up its type. TypeScript only tries to look up the type if the import value is consumed:

    ```js
    // ESM
    import * as dotenvConfig from 'dotenv/config';
    
    // CJS
    const dotenvConfig = require('dotenv/config');
    ```

2. TypeScript locates type declarations via sibling `.d.ts` files. The `dotenv` package provides both `config.js` and `config.d.ts` in the same directory, so TypeScript is happy, even without an explicit `types` condition.

    By the same token, the `types` entrypoint can also be removed from the `dotenv` entrypoint:

    ```diff
     ""."": {
    -  ""types"": ""./lib/main.d.ts"",
       ""require"": ""./lib/main.js"",
       ""default"": ""./lib/main.js""
     }
    ```"
2271360072,1915235142,motdotla,,,"good finds here. 

i think the 'require' was at some time - in an old version of node - the syntax. So I've left that there for dotenv and also added here for dotenvx. Maybe a bit of cruft but I like that it now has symmetry with dotenv - which has a long history of found edge cases by the community that it accounts for. I'm gonna ride on that assumption. "

**Strip execution outputs before committing notebooks**  
The committed JSON contains megabytes of widget state & progress-bar artefacts (lines 254-437 and many more).  
Keeping outputs:

• Bloats the repo (> MB per commit).  
• Generates noisy diffs.  
• Breaks deterministic builds (widgets depend on execution order).

Run `nbstripout`, `jupyter nbconvert --clear-output --inplace`, or add a pre-commit hook to purge outputs before pushing.

This markdown cell states, ""This shows a basic output example of the vision-language model."" However, the notebook currently ends after loading the `unsloth/llava-instruct-mix-vsft-mini` dataset (cell on lines 637-638) and does not provide any subsequent code cells to demonstrate model inference or generate output.

The PR description also mentions tasks like ""interpreting and captioning images"" and ""image-to-text generation and multimodal inference.""

To make the notebook complete and align with its stated goals, please consider adding cells that showcase:
1.  An example of how to use the loaded Pixtral model for inference (e.g., providing an image and generating a caption or answering a visual question).
2.  Optionally, if the loaded dataset is intended for fine-tuning, an example of how to proceed with that."

**Consider using state instead of ref for progress tracking.**

Using a ref to track UI state might lead to inconsistencies during re-renders. Consider using React state instead:

```diff
-const showStakeProgressRef = useRef<Record<string, boolean>>({});
+const [showStakeProgress, setShowStakeProgress] = useState<Record<string, boolean>>({});

// In onApprove:
-showStakeProgressRef.current[amountValue] = true;
+setShowStakeProgress(prev => ({ ...prev, [amountValue]: true }));

**Add missing migration and index for payouts_paused_internally**

It looks like there’s no migration (or schema entry) adding the new `payouts_paused_internally` column or an index on it. You’ll need to:

• Create a migration to add `payouts_paused_internally` to `users` (with a default and null constraint as needed)  
• Add an index on `users(payouts_paused_internally)` for lookup performance  
• Run `rails db:migrate` and confirm `db/schema.rb` includes the column and index  
• Update or remove any references to the old `payouts_paused` column if it’s no longer used

In app/controllers/admin/users/payouts_controller.rb at line 84, the code
updates the attribute payouts_paused_internally on the User model, but there is
no corresponding database migration or schema entry for this new column. To fix
this, create a new Rails migration that adds the payouts_paused_internally
column to the users table with appropriate default and null constraints, add an
index on this column for performance, run rails db:migrate to apply the changes,
and verify that db/schema.rb reflects the new column and index. Also, ensure any
references to the old payouts_paused column are updated or removed if obsolete.

**Add nil check for current_user safety.**

The privilege enforcement method looks good but lacks a nil check for `current_user`. While `require_admin!` likely ensures `current_user` is present, adding an explicit check would make this method more robust and self-contained.

**Good flexibility improvements, consider stronger typing for size.**

Making `color` optional and adding `size` improves the interface flexibility. Both changes are backward compatible.

Consider using `FontSizeTokens` for the `size` property to match the pattern used in `IEarnText` interface. This would provide better type safety than `string`.

@Matts966 I've found the source of the duplicate panel ID issue in the Go code. Looking at `hack/grafana/gen/src/main.go`, I can see that the row panels for the benchmark operator dashboard are created without explicit IDs:

```go
func ValdBenchmarkOperator() *dashboard.DashboardBuilder {
	builder := dashboard.NewDashboardBuilder(""Vald Benchmark Operator"").Uid(""10-vald-benchmark-operator"")
	// ...
	builder.
		WithRow(dashboard.NewRowBuilder(""Benchmark Job Metrics""))
	// ...
	builder.
		WithRow(dashboard.NewRowBuilder(""Operator Metrics""))
	// ...
}
```

The issue is that `NewRowBuilder()` doesn't assign unique IDs to row panels, resulting in multiple rows getting the default ID of 0. 

A fix would be to either:
1. Explicitly assign unique IDs when creating row panels, for example:
   ```go
   dashboard.NewRowBuilder(""Benchmark Job Metrics"").ID(1)
   ```
2. Or check if there's a newer version of the grafana-foundation-sdk that handles this automatically.

Would you like me to help find a suitable way to implement the fix in the Go generation code?

There's a mismatch between the constant definition and its usage. You've defined `agentNGTInfo` (lowercase initial) in line 52, but are trying to use `AgentNGTInfo` (uppercase initial) in line 122, which is causing the build failure.


Fix the undefined identifier by updating line 122 to use the defined constant:

**Fix variable case mismatch in metric name reference.**

There's a critical error in this line. You've defined the constant as `agentNGTInfo` (lowercase first letter) on line 52, but you're using `AgentNGTInfo` (uppercase first letter) here. Go is case-sensitive and this will cause a compile error.

_⚠️ Potential issue_

**Handle “no body” and similar benign errors so `All` doesn’t abort early**

`b.Body()` (and the other single‑source helpers) can legitimately return  
`ErrUnprocessableEntity`, `ErrEmptyBody`, etc. when the incoming request
simply doesn’t contain data for that source.  
`All` should treat those as *non‑fatal* and continue with the next source;
otherwise a perfectly valid request that, say, only has query params will
fail the whole bind.

```diff
-		if err := bindFunc(tempStruct); err != nil {
-			return err
-		}
+		if err := bindFunc(tempStruct); err != nil {
+			// Skip “nothing to bind”‑style errors and continue.
+			if errors.Is(err, ErrUnprocessableEntity) ||
+				errors.Is(err, binder.ErrEmptyBody) {
+				continue
+			}
+			return err
+		}
```

(You may need to import `errors` and, if available, the concrete “empty body”
error from the binder package.)

**Test expectation contradicts the documented precedence (Body > Query)**

`Form binding` sets  

```
Body:  id=2
Query: <none>
```

Yet the expected result asserts `ID == 1`, which can only be left over from
a previous test run.  
Given the precedence `URI → Body → Query → Headers → Cookies`, the final ID
should be `2`.

```diff
-			expected: &User{
-				ID:    1,
+			expected: &User{
+				ID:    2,
```
This also highlights that the same `fasthttp.RequestCtx` instance is reused
across sub‑tests without a reset; stray query parameters, headers or cookies
may leak and mask real issues.  
Either create a fresh context per sub‑test or call `ctx.Request().Reset()`
before applying `RequestConfig`.

**Comprehensive test coverage for the new All binding method.**

The tests cover various scenarios including:
- Invalid output type handling
- Successful binding from multiple sources
- Partial binding with missing fields
- Field overriding based on precedence
- Form binding


The test should run subtests in parallel for better performance:

```diff
for _, tt := range tests {
-	t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
+	t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
+		t.Parallel()
		bind := newBind(app)

Also, use `require` instead of `assert` for error checking to maintain consistency with the rest of the codebase and avoid potential test continuation after failure:

```diff
-	assert.Error(t, err)
+	require.Error(t, err)
```

```csharp
class LinkAssembliesNoShrink : FindJavaObjectsTask // Or some better name
```
Just to reduce confusion around `<LinkAssembliesNoShrink/>` and `AlreadyLinked=true/false`.

The `base` type would write the XML files, and `LinkAssembliesNoShrink` would do the trimmer steps."
2379223800,1987916376,jonathanpeppers,,,"Do we actually need the two sets of output files here? It seems like the files copied to `$(MonoAndroidIntermediateAssemblyDir)%(DestinationSubPath)` would always change when the `*.jlo.xml` file also changes?

This would make MSBuild check a list of extra filestamps, and maybe it's not needed?"
2379223800,1987917734,jonathanpeppers,,,"Should this actually happen in the place these files are written?

Above could do something like:
```csharp
if (!Files.CopyIfStreamChanged (sw.BaseStream, destinationJLOXml)) {
        // If the file was written, the lastwritetime is updated. Touch the file otherwise.
        File.SetLastWriteTimeUtc (destinationJLOXml, DateTime.UtcNow);
}
```"
2379223800,1987928784,jonathanpeppers,,,"Can this use:
```csharp
using (var sw = MemoryStreamPool.Shared.CreateStreamWriter ())
       XmlExporter.Export (sw, wrappers, true);
       Files.CopyIfStreamChanged (sw.BaseStream, destinationJLOXml);
}
```"
2379223800,1988006610,jpobst,,,"I went back and forth on this one. It will absolutely work without the additional check for the normal expected scenarios.  It would fall apart in the ""probably would never happen"" scenario if someone were to delete the `.jlo.xml` file without deleting the `.dll` file.

If we are ok with this then we can save a few milliseconds by not adding the additional outputs."
2379223800,1988016387,jonathanpeppers,,,"The other thing I don't know is if the target will ""build partially"" if you have N inputs and N * 2 outputs.

I've only ever done N inputs and N + 1 outputs (+1 is build.props)."
2379223800,1988017032,jpobst,,,"The issue is that `MarshalMethodsAssemblyRewriter` is modifying the `.dll` in-place much later in the build process (`_GenerateJavaStubs`) than the `.jlo.xml` is being written `(_LinkAssembliesNoShrink)`. This causes it to always be rescanned on the next incremental build of `_LinkAssembliesNoShrink`.

There are 2 other possible fixes for this:
- If we remove the `.jlo.xml` files as Outputs for `_LinkAssembliesNoShrink` then this will not be needed.
- When `MarshalMethodsAssemblyRewriter` gets moved to `_LinkAssembliesNoShrink` it can probably be ordered so that it isn't modifying the assembly after it is being scanned for JLO.

(This does rely on the assumption that `MarshalMethodsAssemblyRewriter` is not changing the assembly in a way that changes the JLO information we need out of it, which is currently a correct assumption.)"
2379223800,1988026974,jpobst,,,"I'm not sure I understand this ""optimization"".

`CopyIfStreamChanged` adds the following overhead:
- Read existing file from disk
- Hash existing file
- Hash stream contents

At best, it eliminates writing the file to disk.  While I admit I haven't tested it, I suspect the reading + hashing (+ maybe writing) is more expensive than simply always writing the file."
2379223800,1988027806,jpobst,,,"I wasn't sure either, but I have tested this with incremental builds and they do still build partially.  😄 

If nothing else, it's good to know this is a valid pattern that can be used in the future if needed."
2379223800,1988029057,jpobst,,,"Yep, I agree that this can be confusing. This seems like a good solution to that confusion."
2379223800,1988032803,jonathanpeppers,,,"This is used for writing `*.java` files, as we were trying to prevent `javac` and `d8/r8` from running again. This made it where assemblies could change, `*.java` files kept same timestamps.

It may not be needed here if some other slow target isn't using the `.xml` files as inputs."
2379223800,1988041965,jpobst,,,I guess one consideration is whether we think running these additional steps after ILLink will be temporary or not.  If we believe the final goal is to implement them as proper linker steps that ILLink runs then this confusion goes away and we would want to keep them all in `<LinkAssembliesNoShrink>`.
2379223800,1989998770,jonpryor,,,"There are many concerns around incremental build performance. Three of which are:

 1. Reducing time spent parsing the `.dll` files.
 2. Reducing time spent generating the `.java` source
 3. Reducing time spent *compiling* the `.java` source into `.class` files. (`javac` is *slow*.)
 4. ""Synchronization""

This PR addresses (1) and *maybe* (2) by making assembly parsing incremental: we only need to process assemblies which have changed.

Should we consider expanding upon (2), (3) and (4)?

The ""Synchronization"" question is rephrased as ""how do we ensure that removed types are deleted""?  For example, if the `MyApp.dll` assembly has:

```csharp
class Demo : Java.Lang.Object {
}
```

then `MyApp.jlo.xml` will mention `Demo`, and `$(IntermediateOutputPath)android\src` will contain `crc64…/Demo.java`, and `$(IntermediateOutputPath)android\bin\classes` will contain `crc64…/Demo.class`.

We then update `MyApp.dll` to *remove* the `Demo` type.  What happens?  What could or should happen?

If we *don't* remove `src/crc64…/Demo.java` and `classes/crc64…/Demo.class`, then we have an unsynchronized state of the world.  (I *think* we've had previous bugs due to this; perhaps @dellis1972 remembers?)

If we delete `src` and `classes`, that means we need to regenerate `.java` files for *everything*, and recompile for *everything*.  We maintain synchronization, but at a cost.  (At least we saved on assembly parsing!)

*An* idea I've been kicking around (mentally and with Dean) was to have *per-assembly* directories.  Instead of `$(IntermediateOutputPath)android\src`, have `$(IntermediateOutputPath)android\jcw\$(AssemblyName)\src` and `$(IntermediateOutputPath)android\jcw\$(AssemblyName)\classes`.  When the assembly changes, we delete *just* the `…\jcw\$(AssemblyName)` directory, and no others.  This should reduce the number of `.java` files we need to generate and `javac` invocations on incremental builds.

I don't know if this is actually *viable*; `javac -d OUTDIR` can only have one directory, so a per-assembly `classes` directory means we'd have *N* `javac` invocations (one per assembly) instead of *1*, and then there's the question of *ordering* (`A.dll` may depend on `B.dll`, creating an ordering constraint on `javac`).

Even if per-assembly `classes` directories aren't viable, per-assembly `src` directories *should* be viable: delete *just* the per-assembly src directory and regenerate it based on the `.jlo.xml` file.

Which brings us to `<GenerateJavaCallableWrappers/>`: is there a way to make `GenerateJavaCallableWrappers.OutputDirectory` a per-assembly value?"
2379223800,1990096101,jpobst,,,"Agreed that this PR only attempts to tackle (1) and that this is just a piece of the build performance puzzle.  However tackling (1) is a very large effort as it also requires updating the other ""_GenerateJavaStubs"" pieces (marshal method rewriting, type map generation, acw map generation, android manifest merging) before we can actually get the win by removing the additional Cecil scan.  As such, I think we should focus on that first.

The important note is that nothing in this PR makes those other existing performance issues _worse_. They remain unaffected.

---

Having said that and looking ahead...

Doing (2) incrementally should be ~easy, but also probably not a huge win.  This step is now very cheap (<50 ms on Android template).

Doing (3) better, if possible, would be a good win. However we haven't examined it enough to know what is viable here.  Even better if work here can also make `D8` incremental as it is even slower than `javac`.  (`dotnet new android` template FastDev build: `_CompileJava`: 1.83s, `_CompileToDalvik`: 4.07s)

(4) is just something to keep in mind for any future attempts to optimize (2) and (3).  We need to ensure that incremental builds remove `.java` files that should no longer be generated."
2379223800,1990112598,jonathanpeppers,,,"I would check a `dotnet new maui` project to see the real cost of `_CompileJava` or `_CompileToDalvik`.

2379223800,1990123330,jpobst,,,"> I would check a dotnet new maui project to see the real cost of _CompileJava or _CompileToDalvik.

Yep, 16.72s and 22.94s respectively, on `dotnet new maui`."
2379223800,1992066499,jonathanpeppers,,,"I don't know if it is temporary or not. We have some conflicting advice on trimmer steps:

* Don't use trimmer steps.
* Only way to do XYZ: use trimmer steps."

2379223800,1992323954,jpobst,,,Removed this `Output`. It mimics places we don't verify outputs elsewhere and leads to simplification of other logic.
2379223800,1992324506,jpobst,,,Removed as no longer needed.

We also no longer need the timestamp of the `.jlo.xml` to always be updated as it is no longer listed as a `Output` of `_LinkAssembliesNoShrink`."
2379223800,1993058215,dellis1972,,,"@jonpryor  We did have issues around deleted files not being removed when we have the enhanced fast deployment. This split the .dex files into a core runtime which was packed in the apk, and a classes.dex which was fast deployed. We had to manage classes being deleted in that scenario. All that does was stripped out though.

It should be able to calculate the list of files we expect to be generated and delete anything that is not in that list but exists in the target folder. We do something similar in Buildapk when updating an existing apk from the one aapt2 produced. "
2379223800,1993845985,jonathanpeppers,,,Very minor: but we could log if it wrote the file.
2379223800,1993849584,jonathanpeppers,,,"Does `XAJavaTypeScanner` also have a list of these?

Maybe they could share the list."
2379223800,1994109095,jpobst,,,That part of `XAJavaTypeScanner` is only used for scanning the old way for the steps that haven't been migrated.  It should go away once we complete the transition.

**Refactor to eliminate code duplication with Llama3RotaryEmbedding.**

The `SmolLm3RotaryEmbedding` implementation is nearly identical to `Llama3RotaryEmbedding` (lines 657-971). The only differences are the config type and naming. This violates the DRY principle and will make maintenance more difficult.

Consider creating a generic implementation that both can use:
- Extract the common rope logic into a generic function or trait
- Pass the config-specific parameters (rope_theta, hidden_size, etc.) as arguments
- Create thin wrappers for model-specific implementations

parameters like rope_theta, hidden_size, and max_position_embeddings as
arguments. Then, replace the current SmolLm3RotaryEmbedding and
Llama3RotaryEmbedding new methods with thin wrappers that call this generic
implementation, eliminating duplication and improving maintainability.

```diff

**Great hook implementation with minor improvement opportunity**

The hook centralizes login logic effectively and follows React best practices with useCallback. Consider awaiting the logout function to ensure cache clearing completes before showing the dialog.

```diff
- void logout();

The `GetCertificate` method returns an error, but it doesn't seem like there are any error conditions that would cause it to return a non-nil error. Consider removing the error return value or adding appropriate error handling. If there are no error conditions, the error return value is misleading.

```suggestion
func (cm *CertMonitor) GetCertificate() (*tls.Certificate) {
	cm.mu.Lock()
	defer cm.mu.Unlock()

you iterate futures in order. Even if they finish simultaneously the loop code will be executed sequentially. Am I missing something? "

**Well-implemented streaming download endpoint.**

This new route effectively implements the second part of the PR objective by creating an endpoint that streams files from S3 on demand. The implementation is clean and efficient with proper error handling.

A few points to verify:


Since this endpoint allows access to files in your S3 bucket, you'll want to ensure there's proper authorization. Run this script to check if there are any auth middlewares or checks in place:

---

🏁 Script executed:

```shell
#!/bin/bash
# Check if there are auth middlewares for this route or parent routes
fd ""middleware\.(js|ts)"" apps/next/app/download --exec cat {} | grep -A 10 -B 10 ""export""

# Check if there are any auth checks in the app folder structure
fd middleware apps/next/app --exec cat {}
```

**Add authentication guard to the S3 download endpoint**

Our search didn’t find any `middleware.ts` under `apps/next/app` or nested in the `apps/next/app/download` folder—in its current form, this route will stream private S3 files to any caller. Please secure it by:

- Adding a Next.js middleware (e.g. `apps/next/app/middleware.ts` or a nested `middleware.ts` in the download path) that validates user sessions or JWTs before hitting the route.  
- Or, in the `GET` handler (`apps/next/app/download/[key]/[name]/route.ts`), verify the request’s authentication token/session and return a 401/403 if unauthorized, before sending the S3 command.

@MayaRainer You're absolutely right, and I apologize for the confusion in my previous comment. The middleware file does exist at `apps/next/middleware.ts` as you pointed out.

@MayaRainer You're absolutely right. I apologize for my incorrect statement. The middleware file does exist at `apps/next/middleware.ts` and it uses Clerk's authentication middleware (`clerkMiddleware`).

From examining the middleware file content:

1. It uses Clerk's middleware which handles authentication
2. The matcher pattern in the config appears to include all routes except static files and the `_next` directory
3. This means your new download endpoint (/download/[key]/[name]) is protected by Clerk authentication

Thank you for the correction, and sorry for the confusion in my previous comment.

@MayaRainer Thank you for the correction. You're absolutely right, and I've confirmed:

1. The `middleware.ts` file exists at the root level and uses Clerk for authentication
2. Based on the matcher pattern in the middleware config, the `/download/[key]/[name]` route would be protected since:
   - It doesn't start with ""_next""
   - It doesn't end with any of the excluded file extensions
   - It falls under the middleware's catch-all pattern

So the download endpoint is indeed properly secured through Clerk authentication. I apologize for my previous incorrect assessment.

@MayaRainer You're absolutely right, and I apologize for the confusion in my previous comment. The middleware file does exist at `apps/next/middleware.ts` as you pointed out.

Let me verify the content of that file to confirm it provides the necessary authentication protection for the download route.

@MayaRainer You're absolutely right. I apologize for my incorrect statement. The middleware file does exist at `apps/next/middleware.ts` and it uses Clerk's authentication middleware (`clerkMiddleware`).

From examining the middleware file content:

1. It uses Clerk's middleware which handles authentication
2. The matcher pattern in the config appears to include all routes except static files and the `_next` directory
3. This means your new download endpoint (/download/[key]/[name]) is protected by Clerk authentication

Thank you for the correction, and sorry for the confusion in my previous comment.

@MayaRainer Thank you for the correction. You're absolutely right, and I've confirmed:

1. The `middleware.ts` file exists at the root level and uses Clerk for authentication
2. Based on the matcher pattern in the middleware config, the `/download/[key]/[name]` route would be protected since:
   - It doesn't start with ""_next""
   - It doesn't end with any of the excluded file extensions
   - It falls under the middleware's catch-all pattern

So the download endpoint is indeed properly secured through Clerk authentication. I apologize for my previous incorrect assessment.

**Add missing index on large_sellers.sales_count**  

No index on `large_sellers.sales_count` was found in `db/schema.rb` or any migrations. Without an index, lowering the caching threshold from 100,000 to 50,000 will degrade query performance as more rows become eligible.

• Add a migration to index `large_sellers.sales_count`, for example:  
```ruby
class AddSalesCountIndexToLargeSellers < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.1]
  def change
    add_index :large_sellers, :sales_count
  end
end

• Benchmark `.cacheable_users` on staging after adding the index to measure DB and Redis load impact.

for sales was lowered from 100,000 to 50,000, increasing eligible users and
query load. To fix potential performance degradation, create a new database
migration that adds an index on the large_sellers.sales_count column. This index
will optimize queries filtering by sales_count. After adding the migration, run
it to update the schema and benchmark the .cacheable_users method on staging to
verify the impact on database and Redis performance.

**Missing logic for ""needsReview"" evidence.**

The code comment implies a scenario where evidence is published but still requires review, yet there's no corresponding condition that increments `assigneeData.needsReview`. This can cause data inaccuracies on the chart indicating “needs review.” 

```diff

  assigneeData.isNotRelevant += 1;

**Reconsider the conditional logic to better align with PR objectives.**

The current condition uses OR (`||`) which means the `.env` file will be loaded if **either** variable is missing. This could lead to partial overrides where one variable is provided via MCP config but gets overridden by the `.env` file.

Based on the PR objective to ""skip loading the `.env` file if environment variables are already set,"" consider using AND (`&&`) logic instead:

```diff
-  if (!process.env[ENV_VARS.N8N_API_URL] || !process.env[ENV_VARS.N8N_API_KEY]) {
+  if (!process.env[ENV_VARS.N8N_API_URL] && !process.env[ENV_VARS.N8N_API_KEY]) {

**Precision loss and missing `hourly` flag**

1. `Number(invoice.totalAmountInUsdCents)` converts a `BigInt` to `number`, silently losing precision beyond `2^53-1`.  While unlikely for an invoice today, this casts away the guarantee that sub-cent accuracy is preserved.

2. The new schema expects an explicit `hourly` boolean.  Omitting it relies on the DB/default, which is brittle for tests that should be self-contained.

```diff
await invoiceLineItemsFactory.create({
   invoiceId: invoice.id,
   payRateInSubunits: Number(invoice.totalAmountInUsdCents),

**Add explicit `hourly: false` to invoice line items**

While converting `BigInt` → `number` for `payRateInSubunits` is required by the `integer` column (and safe within its 32-bit range), you should still explicitly set the `hourly` flag rather than relying on the DB default:

• File: e2e/factories/invoices.ts  
  At the `invoiceLineItemsFactory.create` call, add `hourly: false`.

```diff
 await invoiceLineItemsFactory.create({
   invoiceId: invoice.id,
   payRateInSubunits: Number(invoice.totalAmountInUsdCents),
+  hourly: false,
   quantity: 1,
 });
```

Fixes the omission of the required boolean and keeps tests self-contained.

**Factory lacks `hourly` flag for new line item**

The default `invoice_line_item` now needs `hourly` to be explicit to avoid relying on DB defaults and to let specs exercise both paths.

```diff
-invoice.invoice_line_items << build(:invoice_line_item, invoice: nil, quantity: 1)
+invoice.invoice_line_items << build(:invoice_line_item, invoice: nil, quantity: 1, hourly: false)

Consider adding a `:hourly_line_item` trait to cover the `""hourly: true""` scenario as well.

**‘hourly’ column should be `NOT NULL` to avoid three-state logic**

Every other boolean flag in the schema is declared with `.notNull().default(false)`, e.g. `show_revenue`, `readyForPayment`, etc.  
Keeping `hourly` nullable introduces a third state (`NULL`) that downstream code is probably not prepared to handle and will complicate query predicates.

`totalAmountInCents` relies on JS floating division (`quantity / 60`) which can introduce half-cent rounding errors (e.g. 1 min at $100/h ⇒ 166.666… ¢).  
Prefer integer arithmetic then round once:

**Convert dollars → cents with integer math to avoid precision loss.**

`value * 100` can yield a non-integer (e.g., `12.34 * 100 === 1233.999…`). Store cents as integers:

```diff
- onChange={(value: number | null) =>
-   updateLineItem(rowIndex, { pay_rate_in_subunits: (value ?? 0) * 100 })
- }
+ onChange={(value: number | null) =>
+   updateLineItem(rowIndex, {
+     pay_rate_in_subunits: Math.round((value ?? 0) * 100),
+   })
+ }
```

Keeps `pay_rate_in_subunits` a whole-number, prevents downstream calculation errors, and aligns with the integer arithmetic recommended for `lineItemTotal`.

```
In frontend/app/invoices/Edit.tsx around lines 392 to 401, the conversion from
dollars to cents uses floating-point multiplication which can cause precision
loss. To fix this, replace the expression (value ?? 0) * 100 with
Math.round((value ?? 0) * 100) to ensure pay_rate_in_subunits is always stored
as an integer, preventing downstream calculation errors and aligning with
integer arithmetic practices.

I'll help you test this migration issue. Let me examine the current state and create a comprehensive test to verify the potential NULL constraint failure.




Let me also create a test script to simulate the problematic scenario:




Now let me also check what the factories and existing tests reveal about typical data patterns:




Let me also create a Rails-style migration test to verify the issue:




@slavingia I've created comprehensive tests to verify the migration issue. Here's what the testing reveals:

## The Problem
The migration has a critical flaw: it only updates `pay_rate_in_subunits` for project-based rows (`minutes IS NULL`), but then enforces NOT NULL constraints on all rows. Any hourly rows (`minutes IS NOT NULL`) with NULL `pay_rate_in_subunits` will cause the migration to fail on this line:
```ruby
t.change_null :pay_rate_in_subunits, false
```

## Test Results
My simulation shows that if you have data like:
- Row with `minutes: 120, pay_rate_in_subunits: NULL` (hourly work with missing rate)

The migration will:
1. ✅ Set `hourly = true` (because minutes IS NOT NULL)  
2. ❌ Leave `pay_rate_in_subunits` as NULL (no update for hourly rows)
3. ❌ **FAIL** when trying to enforce NOT NULL constraint

## Recommended Fix
Add this safety update before the `change_null` operations:

```ruby
execute ""UPDATE invoice_line_items SET pay_rate_in_subunits = 0 WHERE pay_rate_in_subunits IS NULL""
```

## Testing Strategy
You should add a proper migration test in `backend/spec/db/migrate/` that:
1. Creates problematic test data (hourly rows with NULL pay rates)
2. Runs the migration 
3. Verifies it handles the edge case without failing
4. Confirms data integrity is preserved

Would you like me to help implement the fix or create the full test suite for this migration?

@slavingia Perfect! The test results confirm the migration issue is **real and critical**. Here's what the testing revealed:

## 🚨 **Confirmed Issue**
The simulation proves the migration **will fail** if there are any hourly rows with NULL `pay_rate_in_subunits`:

```
❌ MIGRATION WOULD FAIL! Found rows with NULL pay_rate_in_subunits:
   Row 2: Problematic hourly row - NULL pay_rate

   The 'change_null :pay_rate_in_subunits, false' would abort the migration!
```

## **Failure Scenario**
Any invoice line item with:
- `minutes: 120` (hourly work) 
- `pay_rate_in_subunits: NULL` (missing rate)

Would cause the migration to crash when it hits:
```ruby
t.change_null :pay_rate_in_subunits, false
```

## **Immediate Fix Required**
Add this safety update in the migration **before** the `change_null` operations:

```ruby
class MakeInvoiceQuantityDynamic < ActiveRecord::Migration[8.0]
  def up
    remove_column :invoices, :total_minutes, :integer
    add_column :invoice_line_items, :hourly, :boolean, default: false
    up_only do
      execute ""UPDATE invoice_line_items SET hourly = true WHERE minutes IS NOT NULL""
      execute ""UPDATE invoice_line_items SET minutes = 1, pay_rate_in_subunits = COALESCE(total_amount_cents, 0), hourly = false WHERE minutes IS NULL""
+     # Safety: Handle any remaining NULL pay_rate_in_subunits before NOT NULL constraint
+     execute ""UPDATE invoice_line_items SET pay_rate_in_subunits = 0 WHERE pay_rate_in_subunits IS NULL""
    end
    change_table :invoice_line_items do |t|
      t.rename :minutes, :quantity
      t.change_null :hourly, false
      t.change_null :quantity, false
      t.change_null :pay_rate_in_subunits, false
    end
    remove_column :invoice_line_items, :total_amount_cents, :bigint
  end
end
```

## **Testing Approach**
I've created a migration test template that should be added to `backend/spec/db/migrate/20250609204642_make_invoice_quantity_dynamic_spec.rb` to prevent similar issues in the future.

**Since this migration appears irreversible and is already in production**, you should either:
1. **If not yet deployed**: Fix the migration immediately
2. **If already deployed**: Create a hotfix migration to handle any data corruption that may have occurred

The testing approach I've demonstrated should be standard practice for all future data migrations - especially ones that change column constraints.

**Critical: Replace hardcoded session token with secure token generation.**

The hardcoded token ""123"" is a significant security vulnerability that could lead to unauthorized access. This appears to be a temporary placeholder after removing the Nango integration.

Please implement proper session token generation with:
- Cryptographically secure random values
- Limited token lifetime
- Proper authentication and authorization checks
- Token validation against the specific integration and user

**Enhance error handling implementation.**

The current implementation has several areas for improvement:
1. Status code 0 is not a standard HTTP status code
2. The component doesn't utilize error details for debugging
3. Missing error props that Next.js provides to error components

Consider this implementation:

```diff
-export default function GlobalError() {
+export default function GlobalError({
+  error,
+  reset,
+}: {
+  error: Error & { digest?: string }
+  reset: () => void

**Improve language configuration maintainability and standards compliance.**

1. The language code 'no' for Norwegian should be updated to follow ISO standards.
2. Consider extracting the languages constant to a shared configuration file to maintain consistency with server-side localization.

Create a new file `apps/portal/src/app/locales/config.ts`:

```typescript
export const SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES = {
  en: ""English"",
  es: ""Español"",
  fr: ""Français"",
  nb: ""Norsk (Bokmål)"", // or nn for Nynorsk
  pt: ""Português"",
} as const;

export type SupportedLocale = keyof typeof SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES;
```

Then update this file:

```diff
-export const languages = {
-  en: ""English"",
-  es: ""Español"",
-  fr: ""Français"",
-  no: ""Norsk"",
-  pt: ""Português"",

**Verify the documentation link.**

The documentation link appears to be for a Shadcn extension, but it's unclear if this is the correct reference for the component's implementation.

---

🌐 Web query:

```web
Is there a Shadcn extension for OTP input? What's the correct documentation URL?
```

💡 Result:

Yes, there is an official **Input OTP** component provided by Shadcn UI. It's designed for one-time password input with features like copy-paste functionality, customizable patterns, and controlled state management[1][7].

The correct documentation URL is:  
**https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/input-otp**[1][7]

Key features include:
- Built on `input-otp` by @guilherme_rodz[1]
- Supports iOS/Android copy-paste functionality[3]
- Customizable separators between input groups[1]
- Pattern restrictions (e.g., digits only)[1]
- React Hook Form integration[3]
- Animated caret effects[1]

For implementation:
```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add input-otp
```
Then update your Tailwind config with required animations[1]. The component supports both composition patterns and render props[1].

This will ensure that users have accurate and up-to-date information regarding the OTP input component.

**Fix font path resolution.**

The font path seems incorrect. In Next.js, public files should be referenced from the root.

Update the font path:

2514036709,2086348547,aomader,,,"Ideally yes, but the low-level SqlClient library may also throw other exceptions (i.e., not `OperationCanceledException`s) to indicate cancellation, which is, I think, the reason why the `IExceptionDetector` was introduced in the first place. So to lift this burden (having to decide whether the exception was caused by cancellation) from the caller, I think it makes more sense to wrap the original one.

A little optimization could be to not do the wrapping but just rethrown in case the exception already is an `OperationCanceledException`, but if I understood you correctly that is not what you were after?"
2514036709,2088167265,roji,,,"IExceptionDetector was indeed introduced because of SqlClient's incorrect behavior - a fix on their side is tracked [here](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/issues/26). However, on the EF side this was done in order to properly **log**, i.e. to not report errors in the log when cancellation occurs. EF makes no attempt to ""correct"" SqlClient's behavior by changing the exception or rethrowing something else ([see this comment](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/issues/26#issuecomment-1598942832)).

While I understand that the current behavior is frustrating, and I understand the desire to have EF ""fix"" SqlClient, EF doesn't do that in any other place, and this PR only touches on exception bubbling up while checking database existence - that doesn't make sense. You can open a separate issue to ask for EF to throw OperationCanceledException, which would track doing that everywhere and not just here (but I don't think the EF team would agree we should do this). So at the very least the concern of correcting the SqlClient behavior should be separate from this PR, which is about handling cancellations correctly while checking for database existence."
2514036709,2088207229,aomader,,,"Understood. I was already aware of that SqlClient tracking issue, but thank you for reiterating the fact that EF is not going to ""fix"" that SqlClient issue.

I updated the doc-string accordingly and adjusted the code to just rethrow. Please have a look again @roji."
2514036709,2088306453,roji,,,"So again, this is not a comment we have anywhere else, including on much more important APIs; for example, queries are executed via LINQ (e.g. via ToList()), and we can't modify the docs on LINQ operators to document this. It's also worth noting that this really is just a SqlClient bug, and I'm not sold on adding this somewhat scary sentence on a very general API that also applies to other providers which are well-behaved...

So I'll go ahead and remove this at least for now. We haven't seen tons of people getting confused by this (and when they have, they generally found their way to the root SqlClient problem), but we can always do a later pass and add a sentence like this across all EF APIs which are potentially affected.

A comment explaining what we're checking for here would also be helpful. In particular `bits` is stored as the absolute positive value. So we're looking for something that fits in 32-bits unsigned but needs more than 32-bits for two's complement signed. This would for example apply to `-2,147,483,649` (`0x8000_0001` unsigned and `0xF_7FFF_FFFF` signed) but not specifically to `-2,147,483,648` (`0x8000_0000` for both unsigned and signed).

Giving examples of where it does vs doesn't apply for each case can help with determining correctness/intent.

**Add hook dependencies to satisfy `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` and prevent stale closures**

`select` and `fit` are referenced inside `useEffect` but are **not** included in the dependency array.  
If either of those callbacks changes (e.g. after a provider hot‑reload) the effect will keep calling the stale versions.

```diff
-  }, [focus.node]);
+  }, [focus.node, select, fit]);
```

This keeps ESLint happy and eliminates subtle bugs that can surface during HMR or when context providers update their memoised callbacks.

I see, but Considering local debugging, a single run on the Playwright side is better. For example, if you want to debug only the web, you cannot control it. Other times, you may want to run tests in the preview environment from a local terminal.

- playwright side: Pass a URL and execute the test cases at that URL
- GitHub Actions side:
    - for Web: Run `pnpm test` passing the deployed web URL
    - for CLI: Run `pnpm test` passing the deployed cli URL
- (local debug): 
    - for Web debug: Run `URL=localhost:3000 pnpm --filter @liam-hq/e2e test`

It's good practice to add a comment explaining why `cd` might fail and what the implications are. This can help with debugging if the script fails in unexpected ways.

Also, consider using `pushd` and `popd` instead of `cd` to manage the directory stack, which can be more robust in complex scripts.

```suggestion
cd ""${TEST_DIR}"" || {
  # If cd fails, it means the test directory is not accessible or doesn't exist.
  # This is a fatal error, as the test harness relies on being in the correct directory.
  echo ""FATAL: cannot cd to ${TEST_DIR}"" >&2

**Provide a more detailed description and usage examples**

A single line “Infinite pixel grid” is too minimal. Please expand this section to include:
- A concise summary of what the pixel grid does and why users need it.
- Installation instructions (e.g., `npm install @grida/grida-canvas-pixelgrid`).
- A basic code snippet showing how to import and render the grid.
- Any key configuration options or API links.

Expanding the README will significantly improve developer onboarding.

**Implement error handling and response caching.**

The API endpoint lacks error handling and caching, which could lead to unexpected behavior and potential rate limiting issues.

Add error handling and consider implementing caching:

```diff
export async function GET() {
+  try {
    const result = await openai.models.list();
    return NextResponse.json({ data: result.data });
+  } catch (error) {
+    console.error('Error fetching OpenAI models:', error);
+    return NextResponse.json(
+      { error: 'Failed to fetch models from OpenAI' },
+      { status: 500 }
+    );
+  }
}
```

You might also want to implement caching using Response headers or a caching solution to avoid hitting rate limits:

```diff
export async function GET() {
  try {
    const result = await openai.models.list();
-    return NextResponse.json({ data: result.data });
+    const response = NextResponse.json({ data: result.data });
+    // Cache for 1 hour
+    response.headers.set('Cache-Control', 'max-age=3600, s-maxage=3600');
+    return response;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching OpenAI models:', error);
    return NextResponse.json(
      { error: 'Failed to fetch models from OpenAI' },
      { status: 500 }
    );
  }
}
```

**Verify compatibility with the major version upgrade**

The package `@ai-sdk/openai` has been updated from an early version (^0.0.x) to ^1.3.16, which represents a major version change. 


Please check the changelog for breaking changes that may need to be addressed in the codebase:

---

🌐 Web query:

```web
What breaking changes were introduced in @ai-sdk/openai v1.0.0?
```

💡 Result:

## Breaking Changes Introduced in @ai-sdk/openai v1.0.0

@ai-sdk/openai v1.0.0 introduced several major breaking changes affecting both the API and usage patterns:

**Major Changes and Removals**
- The ""OpenAI facade"" was removed from the package, meaning direct access patterns via a global or module-level API are no longer supported. Users must work directly with instantiated clients or updated APIs[6].
- The `baseUrl` option was removed, simplifying configuration and requiring a more standardized approach to endpoint specification[6].

**Dependency Updates**
- The release updated dependencies to rely on major new versions of internal provider utilities (`@ai-sdk/provider-utils@2.0.0` and `@ai-sdk/provider@1.0.0`), which may change internal behaviors or available methods[6].

**Interface Consolidation and Refactors**
- Internal provider interfaces were refactored, likely impacting custom integrations or projects extending the package[6].
- Earlier `canary` prereleases introduced some of these changes incrementally, culminating in the full 1.0.0 release with breaking changes.

**Migration & Compatibility**
- This major version bump (to 4.0 in changelog context) signals the presence of breaking changes and the need for application code updates[6].
- While a detailed migration script or code transform isn’t specified in the changelog, similar OpenAI SDKs and provider libraries introduced such tooling for their v1.0 releases[1][5].

**Summary Table**

| Change Area          | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| API surface          | Removed global/module-level facade, must use instantiated clients           |
| Configuration        | Removed `baseUrl` option                                                    |
| Dependencies         | Requires updated provider utilities                                         |
| Extension points     | Internal provider interface changes                                         |
| Release versioning   | Major (1.0.0/4.0) release with breaking changes requiring manual migration  |

These changes require developers to revisit their application initialization, provider configuration, and any custom integrations to ensure compatibility with the latest version[6].

For similar libraries (such as openai-python), migrations to v1.0.0 typically involved:
- Explicit client instantiation rather than using a global default
- Removal of legacy options and objects
- Adjustments for new response shapes and async handling[1][3][4][5]

**Recommendation:**  
Review the [changelog][6] and adapt your usage to instantiate and configure clients per the new API. If you have existing integrations or configuration relying on the removed facade or options, update those accordingly. If further details are needed on migration steps, consult relevant migration guides or the package documentation.

**Review major upgrade to @ai-sdk/openai v1.3.16**

The jump from ^0.x to ^1.3.16 (v1.0.0+) includes several breaking changes you need to address before merging:

- Removed global/module‑level facade → you must now instantiate a client explicitly  
- `baseUrl` option no longer supported → remove any references and rely on the new endpoint parameter  
- Updated internal provider interfaces (`@ai-sdk/provider-utils@2.0.0`, `@ai-sdk/provider@1.0.0`) → adjust any custom integrations or extensions accordingly  
- Potential changes in response shapes and async handling → review all OpenAI API calls for signature or return‐type changes  

Please update your code wherever you import or initialize the SDK (for example in `src/**/openaiClient.ts`, `lib/**/ai.ts`, etc.) to:

- Use `new OpenAIClient({ apiKey, ... })` instead of any global facade  
- Remove `baseUrl` from constructor/config  
- Align custom provider code with the latest interfaces

**Verify compatibility with the major version upgrade**

The `ai` package has been updated from version 3.1.8 to 4.3.9, which represents a major version change.


Please check the changelog for breaking changes that may need to be addressed in the codebase:

What breaking changes were introduced in the ai package v4.0.0?
```

💡 Result:

## Breaking Changes Introduced in the `ai` Package v4.0.0

Several significant breaking changes were introduced in the `ai` package v4.0.0. These affect function signatures, available options, and exported utilities. Below is a detailed overview of the major changes:

**Immediate Return for Streaming Functions**  
- The `streamText` and `streamObject` functions no longer return a Promise; they now return immediately. You should not use `await` with these functions anymore.
  - **Before v4.0.0:**  
    ```js
    const result = await streamText({...});
    ```
  - **After v4.0.0:**  
    ```js
    const result = streamText({...});
    ```
  - The same applies to `streamObject`[5].

**Removal of Roundtrip Options**  
- The `maxToolRoundtrips` and `maxAutomaticRoundtrips` options have been removed from the `generateText` and `streamText` functions.  
- Instead, use the new `maxSteps` option.
- The `roundtrips` property in the `GenerateTextResult` type has also been removed; use the `steps` property instead[5].

**`nanoid` Export Removed**
- The `nanoid` export has been removed. Use the new `generateId` export instead.
  - **Before v4.0.0:**  
    ```js
    import { nanoid } from 'ai';
    ```
  - **After v4.0.0:**  
    ```js
    import { generateId } from 'ai';
    ```
- Additionally, the `generateId` function now generates 16-character IDs by default, up from the previous 7. You may need to update your database schema if there are ID length limits[5].

**Experimental Types Removed**
- The following experimental types have been removed:
  - `ExperimentalMessage`
  - `ExperimentalUserMessage`
  - `ExperimentalAssistantMessage`
  - `ExperimentalToolMessage`
- You should now use their `Core*` counterparts instead: `CoreMessage`, `CoreUserMessage`, `CoreAssistantMessage`, and `CoreToolMessage`[5].

## Summary Table of Key Changes

| Area                          | v3.x Behavior                       | v4.0.0 (Current)                                    |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `streamText`/`streamObject`   | Returns Promise (use `await`)       | Returns immediately, don't use `await`              |
| Roundtrip Options             | `maxToolRoundtrips`, `maxAutomaticRoundtrips`, `roundtrips` property | Use `maxSteps` option and `steps` property          |
| ID Generation                 | `nanoid` export, 7-char IDs         | `generateId` export, 16-char IDs                    |
| Experimental Types            | `Experimental*Message` types        | Use `Core*Message` types                            |

**Migration Recommendation**  
- Resolve all deprecation warnings in your existing v3.x code before upgrading to v4.0.0[5].
- Review and update usages of streaming methods, ID generation, and message types to match the new API.

For a more comprehensive migration guide and detailed examples, review the official migration guide and changelog in the package documentation[5][2].

**Update code to accommodate ai v4.0.0 breaking changes**

The ai package has been bumped from 3.x to 4.3.9. v4.0.0 introduces several breaking changes—most notably, streaming functions no longer return a Promise. Please apply the following updates:

• Remove `await` from all `streamObject` calls (it now returns immediately):  
  – editor/app/actions.ts line 15  
  – editor/app/(dev)/canvas/tools/ai/generate.ts line 45  
  – editor/app/(dev)/canvas/actions.ts line 26  

• No usages of `streamText` were detected. If you add streaming text calls, drop the `await` and work with the returned stream directly.  
• Legacy round‑trip options (`maxToolRoundtrips`, `maxAutomaticRoundtrips`, `roundtrips`) are not present. If you introduce them in the future, replace with `maxSteps`/`steps`.  
• The `nanoid` export removal from ai doesn’t affect us—our code imports nanoid from its own package.  
• No `Experimental*Message` types are in use; if you add them, switch to the corresponding `Core*Message` types.  

After making these changes, verify that all server‑side streaming flows and ID‑generation logic still behave as expected.

The package.json contains basic configuration but is missing important fields:
- No `main`, `module`, or `types` fields to specify entry points
- No version specified
- No repository information
- No explicit TypeScript configuration (tsconfig.json reference)

**Fix parameter selector default values and add prop types.**

There are two issues with the implementation:
1. The `defaultValue` props for the selectors should be arrays based on their implementations, but single values are provided.
2. The component doesn't provide a way to access or modify the selected values from parent components.


Fix the default values and add state management with props:

**Fix defaultValue usage, lift state in selectors, and add ModelParams props**

To allow external control and correct typing:

1. Update each selector to accept an `onValueChange` callback and forward slider changes:
   - In `editor/app/(dev)/canvas/tools/ai/_components/temperature-selector.tsx` (and similarly in the other selectors):
   ```diff
   interface TemperatureSelectorProps {
     defaultValue: SliderProps[""defaultValue""];
+    onValueChange?: (value: number[]) => void;
   }
   export function TemperatureSelector({
     defaultValue,
+    onValueChange,
   }: TemperatureSelectorProps) {
     const [value, setValue] = React.useState(defaultValue);
     return (
       …
       <Slider
         defaultValue={defaultValue}
-        onValueChange={setValue}
+        onValueChange={(val) => {
+          setValue(val);
+          onValueChange?.(val);
+        }}
       />
       …
     );
   }
   ```

2. Define a `ModelParamsProps` interface and update `ModelParams` to accept props and pass them (wrapping each value in an array):
   ```ts
   import React from ""react"";
   import { Button } from ""@/components/ui/button"";
   import {
     Popover,
     PopoverTrigger,
     PopoverContent,
   } from ""@/components/ui/popover"";
   import { Settings2 } from ""lucide-react"";
   import { TemperatureSelector } from ""./temperature-selector"";
   import { MaxTokensSelector } from ""./maxtokens-selector"";
   import { TopPSelector } from ""./top-p-selector"";

   export interface ModelParamsProps {
     temperature?: number;
     maxTokens?: number;
     topP?: number;
     onTemperatureChange?: (value: number[]) => void;
     onMaxTokensChange?: (value: number[]) => void;
     onTopPChange?: (value: number[]) => void;
   }

   export function ModelParams({
     temperature = 0.56,
     maxTokens = 256,
     topP = 0.9,
     onTemperatureChange,
     onMaxTokensChange,
     onTopPChange,
   }: ModelParamsProps) {
     return (
       <Popover>
         <PopoverTrigger>
           <Button
             variant=""ghost""
             size=""icon""
             role=""combobox""
             aria-label=""Load a preset...""
           >
             <Settings2 className=""size-4"" />
           </Button>
         </PopoverTrigger>
         <PopoverContent>
           <TemperatureSelector
-            defaultValue={[0.56]}
+            defaultValue={[temperature]}
             onValueChange={onTemperatureChange}
           />
           <MaxTokensSelector
-            defaultValue={[256]}
+            defaultValue={[maxTokens]}
             onValueChange={onMaxTokensChange}
           />
           <TopPSelector
-            defaultValue={[0.9]}
+            defaultValue={[topP]}
             onValueChange={onTopPChange}
           />
         </PopoverContent>
       </Popover>
     );
   }
   ```

3. Ensure all three selectors (`temperature‑selector.tsx`, `maxtokens‑selector.tsx`, `top-p‑selector.tsx`) mirror the above pattern.  
   This guarantees correct defaultValue typing and allows parent components to read updates.

**New, well-structured PresetSave component.**

The `PresetSave` component is well-designed with clear UI elements for saving a preset configuration. The component handles its own dialog state and form layout cleanly.



However, the component lacks actual save functionality implementation. Consider implementing:

```diff
+import { useState } from ""react"";
+
 export function PresetSave({ disabled, onSave }: { 
   disabled?: boolean,
+  onSave?: (preset: { name: string, description: string }) => void

+  const [description, setDescription] = useState("""");
+  const [open, setOpen] = useState(false);
+
+  const handleSubmit = (e: React.FormEvent) => {
+    e.preventDefault();
+    onSave?.({ name, description });
+    setOpen(false);
+  };
+
   return (
-    <Dialog>
+    <Dialog open={open} onOpenChange={setOpen}>
       <DialogTrigger asChild>
         <Button disabled={disabled} variant=""secondary"">

         </Button>
       </DialogTrigger>
       <DialogContent className=""sm:max-w-[475px]"">
         <DialogHeader>
           <DialogTitle>Save preset</DialogTitle>
           <DialogDescription>
             This will save the current playground state as a preset which you
             can access later or share with others.
           </DialogDescription>
         </DialogHeader>
+        <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
         <div className=""grid gap-4 py-4"">
           <div className=""grid gap-2"">

**Hardcoded URL in PresetShare component.**

The component currently uses a hardcoded URL to the OpenAI platform. This should be replaced with a dynamic URL based on the current preset.


```diff

Add a `presetUrl` prop to the component:

```diff
-export function PresetShare({ disabled }: { disabled?: boolean }) {
+export function PresetShare({

**Complete the color handling refactoring**

Good progress on moving color utilities to the `@grida/cmath` package. The FIXME comment indicates this is part of an ongoing refactoring effort to remove the dependency on the `grida` module.

🏁 Script executed:

```shell
#!/bin/bash
# Check for any remaining color utilities that still use the old namespace
rg ""grida\.program\.cg\."" packages/grida-canvas-io-svg/

**Complete the color handling refactoring**

There are still calls and types using the old `grida.program.cg` namespace in `packages/grida-canvas-io-svg/lib.ts`. Please update these to use the `@grida/cmath` equivalents and remove the `grida` import:

• Remove the old import at the top of the file:
```diff
- import type { grida } from ""editor/grida""; // FIXME: remove dependency
```

• Replace all occurrences of `grida.program.cg.Paint` with `cmath.Paint` in function signatures and return types.  
• Replace `grida.program.cg.FillRule` with the appropriate `cmath.FillRule` (or your chosen default) when reading `fill-rule` attributes.  
• Verify any other `grida.program.cg.*` types/functions are swapped out for `@grida/cmath` utilities.  

Once these are updated, the dependency on `editor/grida` can be safely removed.

**Consider simplifying the API surface and method naming.**

While the functionality aligns with the PR objectives, there are a few observations:

1. **Method count**: The PR description mentions adding ""two overloaded appendAll methods"" but four extension functions are added here.
2. **Naming consistency**: The method names include verbose suffixes (`Iterable`, `WithMap`, `WithMapList`) that may not align with Ktor's typically concise naming conventions.




Please verify:
1. Are all four extension functions necessary for the intended use cases?
2. Can the naming be simplified to follow more conventional patterns like `appendAll(Map<String, String>)` and `appendAll(Map<String, Iterable<String>>)`?

**Consolidate and simplify `appendAll` overload names**

All four overloads are required (vararg pairs, `Iterable<Pair>`, `Map<String, String>`, and `Map<String, Iterable<String>>`) to cover each use-case and avoid JVM signature clashes. However, the current suffixes (`Iterable`, `IterableWithMap`, `IterableWithMapList`) are more verbose than Ktor’s existing conventions (see StringValues.kt).

Please rename as follows:

• StringValuesBuilder.appendAll(vararg pairs: Pair<String, String>)  
• StringValuesBuilder.appendAll(pairs: Iterable<Pair<String, String>>)  
• StringValuesBuilder.appendAll(map: Map<String, String>)  
• StringValuesBuilder.appendAllMulti(map: Map<String, Iterable<String>>)  

Using a concise suffix like **Multi** (or another short, meaningful term) for the second Map overload preserves overload resolution while staying consistent with Ktor’s naming style.

In ktor-utils/api/ktor-utils.api around lines 449 to 452, the four appendAll
extension functions have verbose suffixes that do not align with Ktor's concise
naming conventions. Rename the methods to simplify and standardize their names
as follows: keep appendAll for vararg pairs and Iterable<Pair>, use appendAll
for Map<String, String>, and rename the Map<String, Iterable<String>> overload
to appendAllMulti. This preserves overload resolution and matches Ktor's
existing naming style.

**Critical: Fix early return bug that prevents evaluation of all expectations.**

The function returns prematurely at line 159 inside the expectations loop. This causes the function to exit after the first successful assertion, preventing subsequent expectations from being evaluated.


Move the return statement outside the loop to ensure all expectations are evaluated:

```diff
 			}
 			fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, ""✅ assert_%v passed, expected: %v actual: %v\n"", expect.Op, expect.Value, val)
 		}
-		return nil
 	}
 
 	err = errors.Join(errs...)
-	fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, ""❌ assert failed, err: %v\n"", err)
+	if err != nil {
+		fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, ""❌ assert failed, err: %v\n"", err)
+	}
 	return err
```

```
In tests/v2/e2e/crud/grpc_test.go around lines 82 to 165, the function
handleGRPCWithStatusCode returns prematurely inside the loop at line 159,
causing it to exit after the first successful assertion and skip evaluating
remaining expectations. To fix this, move the return nil statement outside and
after the for loop so that all expectations are evaluated before returning.

2562315498,2122618028,Matts966,,,It's OK if one of the `expect` works.
2562315498,2122618433,coderabbitai[bot],,,"@Matts966 Thank you for the clarification! I understand now that the early return is intentional - you want the assertion to pass if **any** of the expectations succeeds (OR logic), rather than requiring **all** expectations to pass (AND logic). 

The current implementation correctly implements this behavior by returning `nil` as soon as one expectation passes completely. I appreciate you explaining the intended behavior.

Learning: In the handleGRPCWithStatusCode function in tests/v2/e2e/crud/grpc_test.go, the early return at line 159 inside the expectations loop is intentional behavior. The function implements OR logic where any one expectation passing is sufficient for success, rather than requiring all expectations to pass.

I think the lint warning / comment is a bit of a red-herring, as I could never this to error, but the general `invalid_runtime_check_with_js_interop_types` failed (no matter how this line looked).

This got a bit more complicated as locally this passed just fine with and without `invalid_runtime_check_with_js_interop_types` being ignored, but in CI (with an ""even cleaner"" slate it seems) that JS check would still run into the stack overflow.
