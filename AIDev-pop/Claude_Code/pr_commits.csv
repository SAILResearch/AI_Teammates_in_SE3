As noted in #1914, there are cases where trying to interact with a
`text/plain` endpoint that requires input, for instance when receiving a
UUID, may not render correctly.

We should first check if the type is a `Stringer`, aka has a `String()`
method, and use that - otherwise use `fmt.Sprintf(""%v"", ...)` to
generate a string type.

Via [0], we can make sure that we wrap the generated type in an empty
`interface`, so we can perform the type assertion.

This also adds a test case to validate the functionality for:

- a UUID, which has a `String()` method
- a `float32`, which is a primitive datatype that needs to use
  `fmt.Sprintf`

Adds a helper function to compute relative paths between arbitrary directories. This is used to ensure the `source` field in snapshots is relative to the workspace root, even when the project is not a direct child of the workspace directory.

* feat: Update Direct FFI integration with static library build system

- Enhanced GitHub workflow to build and test on both Debug/Release configurations
- Added build_idb_direct.sh script to compile idb_direct as static library
- Created idb_direct.xcconfig for consistent build settings
- Added idb_direct_stub.m for minimal testing without full framework dependencies
- Updated bundle identifiers from com.facebook to org.arkavo across test targets
- Fixed import paths in idb_direct.m to use framework-style imports
- Modified Rust build.rs to link pre-built static library instead of compiling inline
- Workflow now builds frameworks before static library for proper dependencies

This change improves the build process by separating the Objective-C compilation
from the Rust build, allowing for better caching and more flexible development.

  - Checks for eventSink and sendEvent selectors
  - Provides clear error messages for API incompatibility

- Consolidated error codes into main header
  - Added IDB_ERROR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED and related codes
  - Updated error string function to handle extended codes

- Updated build script to include stub implementations
  - All functions return IDB_ERROR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED for now

* feat: Implement Phase 4 - Shared memory screenshots

- Created zero-copy shared memory screenshot API using Mach ports
  - idb_shm_create/attach/detach/destroy for memory management
  - idb_take_screenshot_shm for single screenshots
  - idb_screenshot_stream_shm for continuous capture at specified FPS

- Memory mapped screenshots directly accessible from Rust
  - Avoids data copying between Objective-C and Rust
  - Shared memory key allows cross-process access
  - Supports up to 60 FPS screenshot streaming

- Added comprehensive test programs
  - test_shm.m demonstrates all shared memory features
  - Rust example shows FFI integration with direct pixel access
  - Performance benchmarks included (100+ FPS capture possible)

- Implementation details:
  - Uses mach_vm_allocate and mach_make_memory_entry_64
  - CGImage data copied directly to shared memory
  - Fallback to CGBitmapContext for format conversion
  - Proper cleanup of Mach ports and memory regions

This enables high-performance ML vision loops with minimal latency
and CPU overhead by eliminating memory copies.

* fix: Add adaptive CoreSimulator API implementation for Xcode 16-26 compatibility

- Removed strict API version check that was failing on newer Xcode versions
- Implemented multiple fallback approaches for touch events:
  - postMouseEventWithType:x:y: (older API)
  - sendEventWithType:path:error: (Xcode 15-16)
  - HID tapAtX:y: interface (newer versions)

- Added runtime API detection without hard failures
- Tries multiple methods until one succeeds
- Logs which method was used for debugging

- Screenshot implementation also tries multiple selectors:
  - screenshotWithError: (with error handling)
  - screenshot (without error parameter)

This allows the Direct FFI implementation to work across Xcode 16.2 (CI)
through Xcode 26 (local development) without modification.

CI tests now pass successfully in limited mode.

3144015338,30048eb606284adca81053a916be3ab9acbdbd61,arkavo-com,arkavo-com,"fix: CoreSimulator API compatibility for Xcode 16+

This commit fixes the crash when using idb with Xcode 16+ due to the
removal of the SimDeviceSet.defaultSet selector. The fix implements
runtime API detection to use the appropriate CoreSimulator APIs based
on the Xcode version.

Key changes:
- Added runtime detection for SimServiceContext API (Xcode 16+)
- Updated FBSimulatorControlConfiguration to use sharedServiceContextForDeveloperDir:error:
- Added FBSimulatorSet.defaultSetWithLogger:error: convenience method
- Fixed all idb_direct implementations to use proper API detection
- Added thread safety with dispatch_once for initialization
- Added proper error handling and diagnostic logging
- Added fallback to default Xcode location when DEVELOPER_DIR not set

The implementation ensures both forward and backward compatibility,
allowing Direct-FFI to work on both older and newer versions of Xcode
without requiring recompilation.

Fixes: ""unrecognized selector sent to class"" crash on Xcode 16+

This new strategy:
1. Uses OmniParser for parsing visual state and Gemini 2.0 for evaluation
2. Takes natural language task descriptions instead of recording IDs
3. Processes coalesced actions from events.py
4. Builds and maintains a process graph where states are nodes and actions are edges

The graph is constructed before replay based on recording + task description,
and is updated during replay based on observed states. Uses Pydantic for
structured data handling and robust JSON parsing.

Implements official OpenTofu support requested in issue #74. OpenTofu works
seamlessly with all existing tfautomv features through the --terraform-bin flag.

## Key additions:

- **CI integration**: OpenTofu 1.8.0 installed in GitHub Actions
- **E2E testing**: Two comprehensive tests covering moved blocks and commands output
- **Official documentation**: README section explaining OpenTofu usage
- **Complete compatibility**: Works with all features including --preplanned flag

## Usage:

```bash
# Use OpenTofu instead of Terraform
tfautomv --terraform-bin=tofu

# Works with all features
tfautomv --terraform-bin=tofu --preplanned
tfautomv --terraform-bin=tofu --output=commands
```

## Implementation details:

- Follows existing Terragrunt test patterns for consistency
- No code changes needed - existing --terraform-bin flag handles everything
- OpenTofu tests verify both moved blocks and state mv command generation
- Full CI coverage ensures OpenTofu compatibility in all future releases

Closes #74

- Functions like SUM(quantity) now parse correctly with alias equals syntax

The main challenge is preventing the parser from greedily matching

This needs a more sophisticated parsing strategy.

This commit fixes the T-SQL alias equals syntax parsing issue where
expressions like `ProductName = p.Name` were only parsing `p` and
leaving `.Name` unparsable.

Key changes:
- Remove ""VALUE"" from T-SQL unreserved keywords to allow it as identifier
- Implement proper T-SQL alias equals syntax in SelectClauseElementSegment
- Update grammar to handle `AliasName = expression` patterns correctly
- Clean up unused imports and function definitions

The T-SQL alias syntax now correctly parses patterns like:
- Simple aliases: `TsqlAlias = value`
- Function aliases: `TsqlAlias = SUM(quantity)`
- Column reference aliases: `ProductName = p.Name`

Test results:
- tsql_alias_simple.yml: Completely resolved (no unparsable sections)
- alias_equals_syntax.yml: Working correctly with functions
- Multiple other T-SQL test files improved with better parsing structure

Fixes the issue where select_clause_element nodes were being double-nested
in the parse tree due to incorrect NodeMatcher wrapping.

The SelectClauseElementSegment replacement was wrapping its content in a
NodeMatcher with SyntaxKind::SelectClauseElement, but the parent grammar
was already creating the SelectClauseElement node, causing double nesting.

Changes:
- Remove NodeMatcher wrapper from SelectClauseElementSegment replacement
- Now returns the raw one_of matcher directly
- All T-SQL test files updated with correct single-level nesting

The T-SQL alias equals syntax continues to work correctly while fixing
the structural issue in the parse tree.

Implements issue #63 to allow more Ruby-idiomatic access to workflow outputs
using dot notation instead of hash syntax.

Features:
- Created DotAccessHash wrapper class that provides dot notation access
- Supports nested access: output.step.nested.value
- Boolean predicate methods: output.value? returns false for nil/false
- Direct workflow access: can omit output. prefix entirely
- Fully backward compatible with existing hash syntax

Examples:
- Before: output[:update_fix_count][:fixes_applied]
- After: output.update_fix_count.fixes_applied
- Even cleaner: update_fix_count.fixes_applied

This makes workflow conditions more readable and natural:
until: ""update_fix_count.fixes_applied >= 5 || select_next_issue.no_issues_left?""

When output was passed to AI prompts, the DotAccessHash object was being
shown as a string representation (#<DotAccessHash:0x...>) instead of its
actual content. Added to_s, inspect, and to_json methods to properly
serialize the underlying hash data when needed.

This ensures that when workflows pass output data to AI prompts (e.g., in
ERB templates), the actual data is accessible rather than just the object
reference.

- Add new claude-code provider using official @anthropic-ai/claude-code SDK
- Skip API key validation for claude-code provider (similar to ollama)
- Add claude-code to supported models configuration
- Export ClaudeCodeProvider from ai-providers index
- Include comprehensive unit tests with proper mocking to avoid circular dependencies
- Enable Task Master usage without API keys via Claude Code subscription

BREAKING CHANGE: None - This is purely additive

Implementation approach:
Unlike previous attempts that spawned the Claude CLI directly and handled
stdin/stdout streams, this implementation uses the official Claude Code SDK's
JavaScript API. The SDK provides:
- Async iterator pattern for message handling
- Structured SDKMessage types (system, assistant, result)
- Built-in authentication management
- Automatic process lifecycle handling

This approach eliminates the need for:
- Manual process spawning and stream management
- Temporary file creation and cleanup
- Platform-specific path handling
- Custom readline interfaces for streaming

The provider integrates seamlessly with Task Master's existing provider
architecture while leveraging the SDK's native capabilities.

Tested with:
- All unit tests passing (10/10 tests)
- 84% code coverage for the provider
- Proper error handling for SDK not installed and auth failures
- JSON parsing with markdown code block support
- Streaming text generation capabilities

This fixes an edge case in the FlowUniPCMultistepScheduler where using high sampling step counts (> 50) would cause an assertion error in the last step. The issue was that with lower_order_final=True, the order calculation could become 0 when step_index equals len(timesteps), causing 'assert self.this_order > 0' to fail.

The fix ensures this_order is always at least 1, maintaining stability while allowing higher quality generation with increased step counts.

This adds comprehensive guidance to help users understand tfautomv's intended purpose and avoid common pitfalls:

## Key additions:

- **Best Practices section**: Clear distinction between refactoring vs infrastructure changes
- **Recommended workflow**: Step-by-step process for safe refactoring operations
- **Enhanced --ignore documentation**: Warnings about risks and proper usage
- **Concrete examples**: Good vs problematic scenarios with actual code

## Why this matters:

Users frequently mix refactoring with configuration changes, then use --ignore flags to force matches. This can lead to unintended infrastructure changes and defeats tfautomv's core safety guarantees.

The improved documentation emphasizes that tfautomv is designed for pure refactoring scenarios where the resulting plan should be empty after applying moves.

Addresses confusion raised in issue #101 and provides foundation for better user guidance.

Implements a multi-level validation system for workflow configurations to catch errors early and improve developer experience.

## Schema Validation
- Validates workflows against JSON schema
- Updated schema to support MCP tool configurations
- Provides clear error messages for missing required fields

## Dependency Checking
- Validates tool availability with helpful suggestions for typos
- Checks step references in conditions (if/unless/case)
- Warns about missing target files and prompt files

## Configuration Linting
- Enforces naming conventions (snake_case for steps)
- Detects excessive complexity (>20 steps, >5 nesting levels)
- Security warnings for hardcoded secrets/tokens
- Suggests best practices like error handling

## CLI Integration
- New `roast validate` command for single or batch validation
- `--strict` flag to treat warnings as errors
- Clear, actionable error messages with fix suggestions

## Example Output
```
✗ Workflow validation failed with 2 error(s):
• Tool 'Roast::Tools::BashTypo' is not available
  → Did you mean: Roast::Tools::Bash?
• Step 'undefined_step' referenced in if condition does not exist

Based on PR review feedback, completely refactored the monolithic
ComprehensiveValidator class into a modular architecture:

- Created ValidationOrchestrator to coordinate all validators
- Split validation logic into focused validator classes:
  - SchemaValidator: YAML parsing and JSON schema validation
  - DependencyValidator: Tool, step reference, and resource validation
  - LintingValidator: Best practices and code quality checks
- Added StepCollector for efficient caching of step traversal
- Fixed all edge cases identified in review:
  - Proper nil/empty content handling
  - Regex match nil checks
  - Method naming (has_error_handling? -> error_handling?)
- Made validation thresholds configurable constants
- Removed incomplete security check feature
- ComprehensiveValidator now acts as a thin wrapper for backwards compatibility

This refactoring addresses all SOLID principle violations, improves
performance through caching, and creates a more maintainable and
extensible validation system.

ComprehensiveValidator was a legacy wrapper that simply delegated to ValidationOrchestrator. This commit removes the unnecessary indirection by:

- Deleting lib/roast/workflow/comprehensive_validator.rb
- Deleting test/roast/workflow/comprehensive_validator_test.rb
- Updating all references to use ValidationOrchestrator directly
- Updating documentation to reflect the direct usage

This simplifies the codebase and removes redundant code while maintaining full backward compatibility since ValidationOrchestrator has the same interface.

This commit extracts the validation logic from lib/roast.rb into a dedicated ValidationCommand class, significantly reducing the amount of code in the main CLI file. Key changes:

- Created lib/roast/workflow/validation_command.rb to handle all validation logic
- Removed validate_single_workflow and validate_multiple_workflows methods from roast.rb
- Unified single and multiple workflow validation under one method
- Removed display_validation_errors and display_validation_warnings from roast.rb
- Added ValidationResults inner class to track results across workflows

The new design treats single workflow validation as a special case of multiple workflow validation (with an array of one), simplifying the code and eliminating duplication.

The test_register_with_matcher test was failing in CI because with Zeitwerk autoloading, the StepExecutorFactory is loaded at startup and registers String to use StringStepExecutor. This means custom matchers for String types would never work since class registrations take precedence over matchers.

Fixed by using a custom Struct type instead of String in the test, which doesn't have a default registration and properly tests the matcher functionality.

- Caching validation result to prevent double validation

object-oriented design. This fix provides a proper public interface

Implements configurable retry strategies to handle rate limits and temporary failures:

- Exponential backoff with jitter (default)
- Linear backoff strategy
- Constant delay strategy
- Per-step retry configuration
- Support for idempotent flag to prevent retries on non-safe operations

The retry mechanism integrates seamlessly with the existing error handling
system and applies to all step types including inline prompts.

Implements the --preplanned flag requested in issue #78, providing a cleaner
alternative to PR #95 that better handles multi-directory workflows.

## Key features:

- **--preplanned** flag with **--preplanned-file** option (default: tfplan.bin)
- **Multi-directory support**: Each directory uses its own plan file
- **Auto-detection**: .json extension = direct read, otherwise use terraform show
- **All-or-nothing validation**: All directories must have plan files
- **Performance benefit**: Skip expensive terraform plan operations
- **Enterprise-friendly**: Works with remote state and complex setups

## Usage examples:

```bash
# Single directory with default filename
terraform plan -out=tfplan.bin
tfautomv --preplanned

# Multiple directories
(cd dir1 && terraform plan -out=tfplan.bin)
(cd dir2 && terraform plan -out=tfplan.bin)
tfautomv --preplanned dir1 dir2

# Custom filename
terraform plan -out=my-plan.bin
tfautomv --preplanned --preplanned-file=my-plan.bin

# JSON plans (pre-converted)
terraform plan -out=tfplan.bin
terraform show -json tfplan.bin > tfplan.json
tfautomv --preplanned --preplanned-file=tfplan.json
```

## Implementation details:

- New `GetPlanFromFile()` function in terraform package
- Concurrent plan file reading (same pattern as existing `getPlans()`)
- Clear error messages for missing files or validation failures
- Comprehensive test coverage including 4 new e2e tests
- Full documentation with examples for all use cases

Addresses issue #78 and provides feedback for PR #95.

Changes Python session state preservation to be the default behavior.
Previously, mpremote performed auto soft-reset between command
sessions, clearing variables and imports. Users had to explicitly
use 'resume' to preserve state.

This change:
- Sets _auto_soft_reset = False by default in State.__init__()
- Removes the 'resume' command entirely
- Updates tests to reflect new default behavior

Users wanting the old auto soft-reset behavior can now explicitly
add 'soft-reset' to their command sequences.

Breaking change: Existing scripts expecting auto soft-reset will see
different behavior. Migration: add explicit 'soft-reset' commands
where clean state is required.

- Worker monitors time with no active jobs and exits when timeout is reached
- Exits gracefully by triggering SIGINT for clean shutdown

Instead of trying to extract the display name from existing data (which
was incomplete due to Actor type limitations), we now:

- Add a dedicated USER_QUERY to fetch user display names
- Pass the trigger username to fetchGitHubData
- Fetch the display name during data collection phase
- Simplify prepareContext to use the pre-fetched display name

This ensures we always get the correct display name for Co-authored-by
trailers, regardless of where the trigger came from.

Implements a new `blocks` command to analyze Claude Code usage in 5-hour billing windows as requested in #23:

- Track active blocks with time remaining and burn rate projections
- Support token limits with `-t` parameter (including `-t max` for highest previous block)
- Add `--recent` flag to show last 3 days of blocks
- Add `--active` flag for detailed view of current active block
- Include REMAINING and PROJECTED rows in table view with percentage tracking
- Fix max token calculation to include all blocks (not filtering synthetic models)
- Update README with blocks command documentation

The blocks report helps users understand:
- When their 5-hour session windows start and end
- How many tokens they've used vs their limit
- Projected usage if current burn rate continues
- Time remaining in active sessions

This fixes an edge case in the FlowUniPCMultistepScheduler where using high sampling step counts (> 50) would cause an assertion error in the last step. The issue was that with lower_order_final=True, the order calculation could become 0 when step_index equals len(timesteps), causing 'assert self.this_order > 0' to fail.

The fix ensures this_order is always at least 1, maintaining stability while allowing higher quality generation with increased step counts.

3140025663,e3dbe294f28fb48e3850d049f8da404ae7bfc3f4,leaanthony,leaanthony,"fix: Add Windows UAC execution level support to manifest template

Fixes #4349: Windows admin permissions not persisting between machines

This change adds configurable UAC (User Account Control) execution level
support to the Windows manifest template, allowing developers to specify
admin requirements that persist when executables are distributed.

## Changes Made

### Enhanced Windows Manifest Template
- Added conditional UAC `trustInfo` section to manifest template
- Uses template variable `{{.ExecutionLevel}}` for dynamic configuration
- Backward compatible: no UAC section when execution level not specified

### Project Configuration Support
- Added `WindowsInfo` struct to project configuration
- Added `executionLevel` field for specifying UAC requirements
- Integrated execution level into template data processing

### Template Data Enhancement
- Extended `assetData` struct to include execution level
- Updated template resolution to extract Windows-specific configuration
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing projects

### Documentation Updates
- Added comprehensive Windows UAC guide with examples
- Updated project configuration reference with Windows options
- Included usage examples and supported execution levels

## Usage

Developers can now specify execution level in wails.json:

```json
{
  ""info"": {
    ""windows"": {
      ""executionLevel"": ""requireAdministrator""
    }
  }
}
```

Supported values:
- `requireAdministrator`: Requires admin privileges
- `asInvoker`: Runs with invoker's privileges
- `highestAvailable`: Runs with highest available privileges

## Testing

Verified that:
- UAC trustInfo section is properly embedded in Windows executables
- Admin privileges persist when executables are copied between machines
- Backward compatibility maintained for existing projects
- Template processing works correctly during build

This implements issue #102 to add a basic CLI input step type that allows
workflows to pause and collect information from users during execution.

## Features Added:

- New `input` step type with support for:
  - Text input (default)
  - Boolean/confirmation prompts
  - Choice selection with arrow keys
  - Password input (hidden)
  - Required field validation
  - Optional timeout handling
  - Default values

- State management for named inputs accessible via interpolation
- Full integration with existing step resolution and execution system
- Comprehensive test coverage (unit and integration tests)
- Example workflows demonstrating all input types

## Implementation Details:

- `InputStep` class handles user interaction via cli-ui gem
- `InputExecutor` coordinates execution and workflow state
- Values stored in workflow output for interpolation access
- Added `delegate_missing_to :workflow` to BaseStep for cleaner ERB syntax
- Schema updated to validate input step configuration

## Example Usage:

```yaml
steps:
  - input:
      prompt: ""Enter your name:""
      name: user_name
      required: true

  - input:
      prompt: ""Select environment:""
      type: choice
      options: [dev, staging, prod]
      name: environment

  - bash:
      command: echo ""Deploying to #{environment} as #{user_name}""
```

Closes #102

        [front] - refacto: DataSourceViewsSelector (#10970)

        * [front/components/data_source_view] - feature: implement data source view space selector component

         - Adds a new component DataSourceViewsSpaceSelector for selecting data source views within specified spaces
         - Utilizes SpaceSelector component to filter data source views based on the selected space
         - Integrates loading state handling with a Spinner component while spaces are being fetched

        * [assistant_builder] - refactor: replace DataSourceViewsSelector with DataSourceViewsSpaceSelector

        - Adjusted AssistantBuilderDataSourceModal to use the new DataSourceViewsSpaceSelector component
        - Removed unused imports and simplified the DataSourceViewsSelector component logic

        [trackers] - refactor: update TrackerBuilderDataSourceModal to use DataSourceViewsSpaceSelector

        - Changed TrackerBuilderDataSourceModal to utilize DataSourceViewsSpaceSelector for consistent selector behavior

        [transcripts] - refactor: integrate DataSourceViewsSpaceSelector into LabsTranscriptsIndex

        - Replaced DataSourceViewsSelector with DataSourceViewsSpaceSelector in transcript processing module to align with other components
        - Ensured selection configurations and spaces are passed correctly to the new selector component

        [data_source_view] - refactor: streamline DataSourceViewsSelector and remove unnecessary loading spinner

        - Cleaned up DataSourceViewsSelector by removing conditional space rendering logic and loading spinner
        - Optimized usage of hooks and imports within the DataSourceViewsSelector component

        * [front] - feature: filter spaces to include only those with data source views

         - Add filtering of spaces to show only those that are associated with the current data source views
         - Handle the special case where there's only one space by directly showing its data source views selector

        * fix: lint/format

This commit refactors the TWAP module to use the strategy pattern more
thoroughly for its accumulator updates. Previously, the strategy pattern
was only used for TWAP computation but not for the accumulator updates.

Key changes:
- Add `updateAccumulators` method to the twapStrategy interface
- Implement strategy-specific accumulator update logic for both arithmetic and geometric strategies
- Modify `getInterpolatedRecord` to use the provided strategy's accumulator update method
- Update remaining code to use the appropriate strategy for accumulator updates
- Maintain backward compatibility in exported functions and existing code paths

With this change, geometric accumulator calculations are now only performed
when using the geometric strategy, making the system more efficient by avoiding
unnecessary calculations for the arithmetic strategy.

This implements a much more efficient approach to materializing collections by:
1. Grouping elements by type and serializing them in batches
2. Using compression (gzip + pickle) to reduce storage requirements
3. Implementing chunking for handling very large collections
4. Adding efficient chunk-based loading with caching

The v3 format significantly reduces I/O operations to artifact stores,
dramatically improving performance especially for cloud storage backends.

This fixes an issue where the batch compression implementation was using Python's
built-in gzip.open() directly with cloud storage URIs (like S3), which fails
because the built-in functions only support local file paths.

The solution:
1. Use ZenML's fileio utilities which support various backends
2. Implement in-memory compression/decompression using BytesIO buffers
3. Properly handle reading and writing to cloud storage

The changes ensure our optimized collection materialization works properly with
all storage backends, including S3, GCS, and Azure Blob Storage.
