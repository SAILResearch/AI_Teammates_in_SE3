I've conducted a thorough review of the new Amazon MQ MCP Server implementation and found it to be well-structured, secure, and following the repository's design guidelines and best practices.

### Strengths

1. **Architecture & Design**
   - The implementation uses the Generic AWS Service Tool pattern which provides a clean abstraction for AWS service integrations
   - Security by default with resource tagging to prevent modification of resources not created by the MCP server
   - Command-line flags for fine-grained control, including `--disallow-resource-creation` for higher security environments

2. **Code Quality**
   - Well-structured code with clear separation of concerns
   - Strong typing with appropriate annotations
   - Comprehensive tests with 100% coverage for core functionality
   - Clear documentation in code and README

3. **Security Considerations**
   - Implementation of validators to prevent modification of resources that were not created by the MCP server
   - Appropriate error handling and input validation
   - Docker implementation follows security best practices (using non-root user, pinned base image)

4. **Documentation & Tests**
   - Detailed README with clear explanations of features and security considerations
   - Docker setup instructions and examples
   - Comprehensive test coverage

### Minor Considerations

1. The code coverage report shows a few missing lines in `aws_service_mcp_generator.py`. While overall coverage is good, addressing those few missing lines would be ideal.

2. The PR comments mention that there was an issue with the CI pipeline that couldn't be replicated locally. This might be related to AWS profile access in the CI environment vs. local environment.

### Conclusion

This PR adds a valuable new MCP server for Amazon MQ management that follows the project's coding standards and security practices. The implementation is thorough and well-tested. 

I approve this pull request and recommend merging it.

Hello @yonghao2011, I'm Gemini Code Assist[^1]! I'm currently reviewing this pull request and will post my feedback shortly. In the meantime, here's a summary to help you and other reviewers quickly get up to speed!

This pull request primarily introduces robust proxy support to the `ccusage` tool, enabling it to function correctly in network-restricted environments by automatically detecting and utilizing proxy settings for fetching essential pricing data. This resolves issues where users in certain regions could not fetch data without workarounds. Additionally, it includes a substantial cleanup and simplification of the project's `package.json` file.

### Highlights

* **Network Proxy Support**: Implemented automatic proxy detection using `http_proxy`, `https_proxy`, `HTTP_PROXY`, and `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables to enable `ccusage` to fetch pricing data in network-restricted environments.
* **Undici ProxyAgent Integration**: Integrated `undici`'s `ProxyAgent` for all `fetch` requests that require proxying, ensuring proper routing of network traffic for external data retrieval.
* **Build-Time Proxy Support**: Extended proxy functionality to the build process, specifically for pre-fetching Claude pricing data via `src/_macro.ts`, resolving potential build failures in restricted networks.
* **Debugging & Observability**: Added informative logging to `src/pricing-fetcher.ts` to indicate when a proxy is detected and being used, aiding in troubleshooting network connectivity issues.
* **Project Configuration Cleanup**: Performed a significant cleanup and reduction of the `package.json` file, removing various development-related scripts, dependencies, and configurations, streamlining the project setup.

This pull request adds proxy support for fetching pricing data, which enhances the tool for users in network-restricted environments. The implementation uses environment variables and `undici`'s `ProxyAgent`. The `package.json` file has been unintentionally stripped of essential development configuration, which needs to be reverted. The proxy detection and setup logic is duplicated across two files, which should be refactored into a shared utility function."

<summary>src/pricing-fetcher.ts (1)</summary><blockquote>

`66-78`: **Consider adding tests for proxy functionality.**

The proxy support functionality is not covered by the existing test cases. Consider adding tests to verify:
- Proxy detection from environment variables
- ProxyAgent usage when proxy is configured
- Fallback behavior when no proxy is configured



Example test structure:
```typescript
describe('proxy support', () => {
  it('should use proxy when environment variable is set', async () => {
    process.env.https_proxy = 'http://proxy.example.com:8080';
    // Test implementation
  });
  
  it('should work without proxy when no environment variable is set', async () => {
    delete process.env.https_proxy;
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```

`1-34`: **LGTM! Package.json simplified appropriately for published package.**

The removal of all development configurations (workspaces, scripts, devDependencies, etc.) is appropriate for a published npm package, focusing solely on essential package metadata. This simplification aligns well with the proxy support feature and improves package clarity.

This PR integrates Claude Code AI assistant into the Nx repository by adding GitHub Actions workflows and workspace configuration, updating dependencies, and enhancing documentation and contribution guidelines.

- Added a new GitHub Actions workflow (`claude.yml`) to trigger Claude Code on issue and PR events, and updated the existing CI workflow (`ci.yml`) to install pnpm, cache Rust, and unify environment settings.
- Introduced Claude integration docs (`CLAUDE.md`), command reference guides under `.claude/commands`, and Model Context Protocol configuration (`.mcp.json`).
- Updated `package.json` with new AI-related dependencies, enhanced `CONTRIBUTING.md` with project structure and commit guidelines, and assigned CODEOWNERS for Claude files.

- There’s a lot of repetitive `sys.stderr.write` calls across tests—consider factoring them into a shared helper function or logger to reduce duplication and standardize formatting.
- Many tests catch broad `Exception` and return `-1`, swallowing stack traces; to aid debugging it would be better to include `traceback.format_exc()` or let the exception bubble so you get full context.

3081411791,2859630959,awslabs-mcp,COMMENTED,2025-05-22T03:00:52Z,"## MySQL MCP Server PR Review

I've conducted a thorough review of this PR which adds Aurora MySQL MCP server support. Overall, this is a solid contribution that follows many of the established patterns for MCP servers. Here's my assessment:

### Strengths
- Comprehensive SQL injection protection with robust pattern detection
- Good implementation of readonly mode for safe database access
- Strong test coverage with tests for various SQL patterns and edge cases
- Clear documentation in README.md with installation and configuration instructions
- Proper error handling and logging
- Appropriate async/await patterns for database operations

### Workflow Run
- Run ID: 15176895586
- Most checks are passing, however there is a failing ""fail-by-label"" check. This appears to be related to labels on the PR.

### Recommendations for Improvement
1. Consider creating a dedicated `models.py` file with proper Pydantic models for requests/responses
2. Move global error message constants to a separate `consts.py` file
3. Add more detailed instructions in the MCP initialization (`instructions` parameter)
4. Add timeouts for long-running queries
5. Implement a maximum result set size limit
6. Replace the type ignore comment on line 190 with a proper Pydantic return type

These suggestions align with the MCP design guidelines and would improve code organization, safety, and documentation."
3081411791,2859631286,awslabs-mcp,APPROVED,2025-05-22T03:01:09Z,"## Final Review Decision: APPROVE

I'm approving this pull request to add MySQL MCP server support. The implementation is solid, well-tested, and follows AWS security best practices with its SQL injection protection and readonly mode configuration.

While I've recommended some improvements in my previous review comment regarding code organization and Pydantic models, these are enhancements rather than blockers. The current implementation:

1. Correctly implements the MCP server pattern
2. Provides excellent security features
3. Has comprehensive test coverage
4. Follows AWS authentication best practices
5. Has clear documentation

Great work on this contribution to the MCP ecosystem, adding support for Aurora MySQL\!

- **Reason this comment was not posted:** 
Decided after close inspection that this draft comment was likely wrong and/or not actionable: usefulness confidence = 10% vs. threshold = 85%
While having a trailing newline is a common best practice, this kind of minor formatting issue doesn't meet the bar for a required code change per our review rules. It's not affecting functionality, readability or maintainability in any significant way. The rules state we should not make purely informative comments or comments about obvious/unimportant issues.
A missing trailing newline could potentially cause issues with some text processing tools or version control systems. It's a widely accepted convention.
While true, this is still too minor of an issue to warrant a PR comment. Any serious issues would be caught by linters or the build process.
Delete this comment as it's too minor of an issue and doesn't meet our bar for required code changes.

- **Draft comment:** 
When using innerHTML to render dynamically generated content, ensure that the data is sanitized if the source ever becomes external to avoid XSS vulnerabilities.
- **Reason this comment was not posted:** 
Decided after close inspection that this draft comment was likely wrong and/or not actionable: usefulness confidence = 20% vs. threshold = 85%
1. The data is completely static and hardcoded in the file
2. There is no external data source or user input
3. The comment is about a hypothetical future scenario rather than current code
4. The comment is speculative (""if the source ever becomes external"")
5. This violates our rule about speculative comments
The comment raises a valid security concern that could become relevant if the code is modified in the future to accept external data.
While security is important, we should focus on actual issues rather than hypothetical ones. The current implementation has no security risk since all data is static.
Delete the comment as it's speculative and not relevant to the current implementation. It violates our rule about making speculative ""if X, then Y"" comments.

- **Draft comment:** 
It looks like the description for 'Mistral Integration' says 'Using Mistral/Mixtral models'. This may be a typographical error—choose one consistent name (e.g., 'Mistral models') to avoid confusion.
- **Reason this comment was not posted:** 
Decided after close inspection that this draft comment was likely wrong and/or not actionable: usefulness confidence = 0% vs. threshold = 85%
This is a new file, so the comment is about changed code. However, ""Mistral/Mixtral"" is likely intentional since Mixtral is a specific model family from Mistral AI. The comment seems to misunderstand that these are related products from the same company. The suggestion would actually reduce clarity by removing relevant information.
Maybe there's a better way to format the model names? Perhaps there's a style guide I'm not aware of?
The current format is clear and accurate - Mistral/Mixtral is a common way to reference both model families, and it's more helpful to users to know both are supported.
The comment should be deleted as it suggests removing useful information based on a misunderstanding of the Mistral AI product lineup.

I've reviewed this PR which adds documentation for remediating detected secrets to the DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md file.

The changes are well-structured, address issue #199, and provide clear instructions for developers who encounter issues with the detect-secrets pre-commit hook. The documentation includes:

1. Explanation of the problem scenario
2. Clear step-by-step commands to resolve the issue
3. Helpful comments explaining what each command does

All checks are passing (except for the 'claude' check which is still pending). The changes are well-formatted, consistent with the existing documentation style, and provide valuable information for contributors.

This addition will improve the developer experience and reduce confusion when working with the pre-commit hooks and secret detection in this repository.

I approve this PR as it meets all the repository's standards and effectively addresses the original issue.

Implements dot‐notation access for workflow outputs and refactors configuration loading and command execution to improve structure and readability.  
- Introduces a DotAccessHash wrapper and OutputManager integration in `BaseWorkflow` for direct `output.foo.bar?` access.  
- Refactors `Configuration` to delegate API handling to `ApiConfiguration` and step lookup to `StepFinder`.  
- Adds a new `CommandExecutor` helper and value objects (`WorkflowPath`, `StepName`, `ApiToken`) for validation and clarity.

Hello @dsaluja, I'm Gemini Code Assist[^1]! I'm currently reviewing this pull request and will post my feedback shortly. In the meantime, here's a summary to help you and other reviewers quickly get up to speed!

This pull request significantly enhances the Zen MCP server's stability and reliability by addressing critical memory leaks and improving background thread management. It introduces a controlled token cache to prevent memory exhaustion, refines the graceful shutdown of background processes, and improves diagnostic capabilities through more explicit error logging and new background monitoring.

### Highlights

* **Memory Leak Mitigation**: I've implemented a bounded, LRU-style token cache within the `GeminiModelProvider` to prevent unbounded growth of the `_token_counters` dictionary. This includes new methods for cache cleanup, tracking cache hits and misses, and providing performance statistics.
* **Enhanced Server Stability**: I've improved the graceful shutdown mechanism for the storage backend's cleanup worker thread. The worker now sleeps in smaller intervals, allowing for more frequent checks of the shutdown flag, and the `shutdown` method has an increased join timeout with more detailed logging for thread termination status.
* **Improved Error Visibility**: I've replaced instances of silent exception swallowing (`except Exception: pass`) in `server.py` with explicit warning logging. This ensures that failures related to activity logging are now properly recorded, aiding in diagnosis.
* **Background Monitoring**: I've introduced a new asynchronous background task (`_start_cache_monitoring`) in `server.py` to periodically monitor and log the number of active conversation threads in the storage backend, providing ongoing insight into memory usage.

I've reviewed the pull request that adds a default dev container configuration to the MCP project. This change adds a `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file to help streamline the development setup process.

### Overview of Changes

The PR adds a development container configuration that:

1. Uses Microsoft's universal development container image as a base
2. Includes support for multiple languages (Python, TypeScript, Ruby, Rust, Terraform)
3. Configures VS Code extensions for AWS development tools, Python tools, and GitHub integration
4. Sets up post-creation commands to install development dependencies
5. Specifies minimum system requirements (4 CPUs)

### Analysis

The addition aligns well with the project's development needs:
- It addresses a gap mentioned in the DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md where it states ""there is no dedicated development container""
- All the required development tools mentioned in the guides are covered
- Extensions for AWS development workflows are included appropriately
- The base image provides a comprehensive starting point for MCP development

3044757080,2820442004,awslabs-mcp,CHANGES_REQUESTED,2025-05-07T06:00:45Z,"## Final Review Decision

I'm requesting changes on this PR due to JSON formatting issues in the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file.

### What's Working Well

The PR adds a valuable development container configuration that:
- Simplifies environment setup for new contributors
- Ensures consistent development environments
- Includes necessary tools and extensions for MCP server development
- Addresses a gap noted in the DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md

### Required Changes

The pre-commit check is failing because of JSON formatting issues:

1. **Property ordering**: The JSON properties need to be ordered alphabetically according to project conventions:

   The top-level properties should be ordered as:
   - ""customizations""
   - ""features""
   - ""hostRequirements""
   - ""image""
   - ""postCreateCommand""

2. Within the ""features"" object, the properties should also follow alphabetical ordering.

Once these formatting issues are fixed, the PR will be ready for approval as it adds significant value to the development workflow.

This PR adds a devcontainer.json file to the project which is a valuable addition that provides a consistent development environment for contributors.

### Positive Aspects
- The container includes all necessary tools (Python, Terraform, uv, pre-commit, etc.)
- Appropriate VS Code extensions are included for AWS, Python, and GitHub
- Host requirements are specified (4 CPUs minimum)
- Universal container image is used as the base
- All CI checks are passing

### Issues to Address
1. The post-creation command contains an error: `pip install -y uv` should be `pip install uv` (pip doesn't use the -y flag)
2. Documentation updates are needed:
   - DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md states 'there is no dedicated development container' - this should be updated
   - README.md should mention the dev container option
   - Instructions for using the dev container should be added

### Recommendation
This PR should be improved with the documentation updates and fix for the pip command before merging.

   - Update DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md to remove the statement ""At the moment, there is no dedicated development container""
   - Add a section in DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md about how to use the dev container
   - Consider adding a brief mention in README.md about the dev container option

### Additional Suggestions (Optional)

- Consider adding more detailed comments in the devcontainer.json file explaining the purpose of key configurations
- You might want to include Python linting extensions (pylint, flake8, etc.)

Once these changes are made, this PR will be ready for approval. The addition of a dev container is a valuable improvement to the project's development workflow.

I've reviewed PR #292 which implements container image building and publishing to public ECR for all MCP servers that have a Dockerfile. This feature allows users to pull container images directly without having to build them locally.

### Changes Summary
- Added a new GitHub action (`build-and-push-container-image`) that handles building and pushing Docker images to AWS Public ECR
- Modified the `release.yml` workflow to use this action when publishing Python packages, but only for packages that have a Dockerfile
- The action builds images using the package version from the Python package and includes appropriate metadata and labels
- Images are currently built only for Linux/AMD64 platform (with plans for ARM64 later)
- The workflow uses secure AWS authentication and role assumption for ECR publishing

### Positive Points
- Implements the feature as proposed in RFC #274
- Reuses existing CI infrastructure effectively
- Follows security best practices for credential handling
- Action uses pinned dependency versions for security
- Includes proper error handling and artifact uploads
- Code is clean and well-commented

All automated checks are passing (except for the Claude review which is in progress). The implementation is well-structured and doesn't modify any application code - it only enhances the CI/CD process.

This enhancement will make it significantly easier for users to run MCP servers in containerized environments by removing the need to build images locally. I recommend approval.

I've reviewed PR #292 ""feat: push container images"" which implements container image publishing to AWS Public ECR during the release process. The PR addresses issue #274.

### Changes
- Added GitHub action for building and pushing container images (.github/actions/build-and-push-container-image/action.yml)
- Updated release workflow (.github/workflows/release.yml) to call this action during the PyPI publish step when a Dockerfile is present
- Removed unused code review workflows

### Assessment
- The action correctly implements multi-architecture builds (amd64/arm64) using Docker Buildx
- Proper tagging is configured using a combination of version numbers and SHA
- Container metadata is correctly added with useful labels
- Security best practices are followed with pinned action versions and role-based authentication

All status checks are passing, and the implementation aligns well with the requirements specified in RFC #274. The approach successfully enables users to pull container images without needing to build them locally.

Hello @guidedways, I'm Gemini Code Assist[^1]! I'm currently reviewing this pull request and will post my feedback shortly. In the meantime, here's a summary to help you and other reviewers quickly get up to speed!

This pull request introduces a fundamental shift in the Zen MCP Server's architecture, moving from simple request-response patterns to sophisticated, workflow-based tools. This change is designed to improve the efficiency, accuracy, and cost-effectiveness of AI-assisted software development by enabling more structured, context-aware, and adaptive problem-solving processes.

### Highlights

* **Workflow-Driven Architecture**: The core change is the transformation of Zen MCP Server tools into intelligent, step-by-step workflows. This new architecture guides Claude through structured processes, enhancing accuracy and contextual understanding for complex development tasks.
* **Intelligent Model Selection**: Tools now intelligently assess Claude's confidence, invoking external, potentially more expensive, models only when necessary. This dynamic routing and cost-effective fallback mechanism aims to significantly reduce token usage and optimize costs.
* **Enhanced Tool Capabilities**: All major tools (Debug, Code Review, Refactor, Test Generation, Pre-commit Validation, Analysis, Think Deep) have been re-engineered as intelligent workflows, providing systematic investigation, comprehensive analysis, and adaptive planning capabilities.
* **Comprehensive Testing**: The enhancement includes 10 new simulation tests and updated unit tests to validate the new workflow architecture, ensuring robust cross-tool conversation continuation, memory management, and token allocation.
* **Backward Compatibility**: Despite the major architectural changes, existing tool interfaces and configurations remain compatible, ensuring a smooth transition for current users while introducing powerful new capabilities.

3138027382,2918595621,jonallured,COMMENTED,2025-06-11T20:34:21Z,"## PR Review: Add comprehensive workflow validation

### Overall Assessment

This PR introduces a comprehensive validation system for Roast workflows, which is a significant improvement to the developer experience. The implementation is generally well-structured and thoughtful, but there are several areas of concern that should be addressed before merging.

### Strengths

1. **Well-structured validation levels**: The three-tier validation approach (schema, dependencies, linting) is logical and comprehensive
2. **Excellent error messaging**: Clear, actionable error messages with helpful suggestions  
3. **Good test coverage**: The test suite covers most validation scenarios thoroughly
4. **CLI integration**: Clean integration with the existing CLI using Thor
5. **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation in VALIDATION.md
6. **Backward compatibility**: The validation is optional and doesn't break existing workflows

### Major Concerns

#### 1. Architectural Inconsistency with Code Smells

The **ComprehensiveValidator** class violates several SOLID principles:
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: The class handles YAML parsing, schema validation, dependency checking, linting, and error formatting all in one place
- **Large class smell**: At 480 lines, this class is doing too much  
- The private method section spans 440+ lines, suggesting the class should be broken down

**Recommendation**: Refactor into separate validator classes:
```ruby
module Roast::Workflow::Validators
  class SchemaValidator; end
  class DependencyValidator; end  
  class LintingValidator; end
  class ValidationOrchestrator; end
end
```

#### 2. Performance Concerns

Several methods have inefficient implementations:

- **collect_all_steps** is called multiple times and recursively traverses the entire configuration
- **detect_used_tools** always returns an empty array (line 447), making the unused tools check non-functional
- Multiple passes over the same data structure for different validations

**Recommendation**: Cache collected steps and optimize traversal:
```ruby
def initialize(yaml_content, workflow_path = nil)
  # ... existing code ...
  @all_steps = nil # lazy-loaded cache
end

def all_steps
  @all_steps ||= collect_all_steps(@parsed_yaml)
end
```

#### 3. Missing Error Handling Edge Cases

- Line 189: `property = error.match(/required property of '([^']+)'/)[1]` will raise **NoMethodError** if the regex doesn't match
- No handling for circular references in workflow structures
- Missing validation for MCP tool configuration structure

#### 4. Security False Positives

The hardcoded values check (lines 459-477) uses simple regex matching that will produce many false positives:
- Will flag any YAML with ""token"" in it, even documentation
- No context awareness (e.g., distinguishing between actual secrets vs. example values)

**Recommendation**: Add context-aware checking or make this opt-in.

#### 5. Incomplete Tool Detection

The **detect_used_tools** method (line 443) is stubbed out, meaning the unused tools warning will never work correctly. This should either be implemented or the feature removed.

### Minor Issues

1. **Magic Numbers**: Hard-coded limits (20 steps, 5 nesting levels) should be configurable constants
2. **Inconsistent Error Structure**: Some errors have **:line** and **:column**, others don't
3. **Missing MCP validation**: MCP tools are marked as valid (line 216) without checking their configuration
4. **Test Brittleness**: Test on line 86 uses **send** to access private methods, indicating design issues

### Code Style Issues

1. **Method Length**: Several methods exceed 20 lines (e.g., **lint_step_complexity**, **check_step_references**)
2. **Complex Conditionals**: Deep nesting in **check_step_references** makes it hard to follow
3. **Naming**: **has_error_handling?** should be **error_handling?** per Ruby conventions

### Missing Test Coverage

1. No tests for YAML parsing errors with specific line/column numbers
2. No tests for circular reference detection
3. No tests for the **detect_used_tools** functionality
4. No integration tests with actual workflow execution

### Recommendations

1. **Refactor before merging**: Break down the **ComprehensiveValidator** into smaller, focused classes
2. **Implement or remove**: Either implement **detect_used_tools** or remove the unused tools warning
3. **Add configuration**: Make validation thresholds configurable
4. **Fix error handling**: Add proper nil checks and error boundaries
5. **Consider gradual rollout**: Perhaps make this opt-in initially with a feature flag

### Risk Assessment

**Medium Risk**: While the validation itself won't break existing functionality, the architectural issues could make future maintenance difficult. The performance concerns could impact users with large workflow collections.

### Verdict

**Request Changes**: The feature is valuable, but the implementation needs architectural improvements before merging. The current monolithic design contradicts the project's stated architectural guidelines about maintaining proper separation of concerns."

`736-736`: **Fix undefined symbol causing build failure.**

The pipeline shows `unix.TIOCGETA` is undefined, causing a build error. This constant is BSD-specific and won't work on Linux.



Apply this platform-specific fix:

```diff
-	termios, err := unix.IoctlGetTermios(int(p.pty.Fd()), unix.TIOCGETA)
+	termios, err := unix.IoctlGetTermios(int(p.pty.Fd()), ioctlGetTermios)
```

The `ioctlGetTermios` constant should already be defined elsewhere in the codebase for cross-platform compatibility.



Verify the correct constant is available:

```shell
#!/bin/bash
# Search for the correct cross-platform ioctl constant
rg ""ioctlGetTermios"" --type go
# Also check what constants are available in the unix package
rg ""TIOCG.*="" --type go

`314-314`: **Consider consistent callback execution patterns.**

DirectOutput callbacks use goroutines (non-blocking) while RawPTY callbacks are synchronous (blocking). This inconsistency could lead to confusion.

For consistency and to prevent slow callbacks from blocking PTY processing, consider making both non-blocking:

```diff
 func (m *Manager) NotifyRawPTY(sessionID string, data []byte) {
 	rawCallbackMutex.RLock()
 	callbacks := rawPTYCallbacks[sessionID]
 	rawCallbackMutex.RUnlock()
 	
 	for _, callback := range callbacks {
-		callback(sessionID, data) // Direct call - no goroutine for raw speed
+		go callback(sessionID, data) // Non-blocking like DirectOutput
 	}
 }
```

If raw speed is critical and you need synchronous execution, document this difference clearly in the type definitions.

`151-152`: **Excellent optimization for real-time terminal streaming.**

The 100x reduction in timeout (100ms → 1ms) dramatically improves responsiveness for the callback-driven PTY streaming introduced in this PR. This change is essential for achieving the stated 72% reduction in WebSocket updates.

</details>
<details>
<summary>linux/pkg/session/eventloop_darwin.go (1)</summary>

`143-146`: **Cross-platform consistency achieved.**

The timeout reduction matches the Linux implementation, ensuring uniform responsiveness across platforms. The nanosecond calculation for 1ms is correct.

</details>
<details>
<summary>linux/pkg/session/terminal.go (2)</summary>

`6-6`: **Runtime import appropriately added.**

The runtime import is needed for the platform-specific IUTF8 flag logic.

---

`44-49`: **UTF-8 support enhancement with proper platform detection.**

The conditional IUTF8 flag enables proper UTF-8 input processing on Linux, aligning with node-pty behavior. The hardcoded flag value is acceptable since this is a Linux-specific constant.




Verify that the IUTF8 constant value is correct:

```shell
#!/bin/bash
# Verify IUTF8 constant value on Linux systems
if [ ""$(uname)"" = ""Linux"" ]; then
    # Check if the value matches system headers
    grep -r ""IUTF8"" /usr/include/ 2>/dev/null | head -5
fi

# Also check if golang.org/x/sys/unix defines this constant
rg ""IUTF8.*0x00004000"" || echo ""Custom constant definition needed""
```

</details>
<details>
<summary>linux/pkg/session/select.go (1)</summary>

`136-149`: **Excellent implementation of direct PTY streaming callbacks.**

This change is architecturally significant for the flickering reduction goal:

1. **Immediate notification**: Callbacks fire instantly when PTY data is available, eliminating file I/O delays
2. **Dual callback types**: `NotifyDirectOutput` for terminal buffers and `NotifyRawPTY` for WebSocket streaming
3. **Zero-copy approach**: Uses the same `outputData` for both stream writing and callbacks

This enables the claimed 72% reduction in WebSocket updates by providing real-time data flow.

</details>
<details>
<summary>linux/pkg/session/pty.go (1)</summary>

`366-379`: **Consistent implementation of direct streaming callbacks.**

The callback mechanism implementation matches the pattern in `select.go`, ensuring consistent behavior across different I/O handling modes. The immediate notifications enable real-time PTY data streaming.

</details>
<details>
<summary>linux/pkg/api/server.go (2)</summary>

`142-148`: **LGTM! Raw WebSocket endpoint follows established patterns.**

The implementation correctly mirrors the buffer WebSocket handler pattern above it, including proper authentication middleware wrapping.

---

`700-700`: **Good addition for Node.js compatibility.**

Supporting the `Key` field enables compatibility with Node.js-style input events like `{key: ""enter""}`, which improves interoperability.



Also applies to: 715-717

</details>
<details>
<summary>linux/pkg/termsocket/manager.go (2)</summary>

`157-224`: **Excellent refactoring to direct PTY callbacks!**

This change significantly improves performance by:
- Eliminating file I/O delays with direct memory streaming
- Implementing proper 50ms debouncing like Node.js
- Cleaning up resources properly on session end or shutdown

The removal of file watching in favor of direct callbacks aligns perfectly with the PR's goal of reducing flickering.

---

`278-321`: **Well-implemented debouncing and deduplication logic.**

The vt10x-inspired deduplication using sequence IDs and change flags effectively reduces redundant WebSocket updates. The 50ms debouncing timer is appropriately managed with proper cleanup.

</details>
<details>
<summary>linux/pkg/api/raw_websocket.go (1)</summary>

`120-161`: **Clean implementation of PTY streaming with debouncing.**

The 50ms debouncing logic is well-implemented with proper mutex usage and timer cleanup. The pattern matches the Node.js approach mentioned in the PR objectives.

</details>
<details>
<summary>web/src/input.css (1)</summary>

`1-749`: **Comprehensive dark theme implementation.**

The CSS provides excellent coverage for terminal UI components with:
- Consistent dark theme colors and transitions
- Proper font configurations with ligature control
- Mobile-specific touch handling
- Well-structured component styles

The 100ms view transition duration aligns with the goal of reducing animation flickering.

</details>
<details>
<summary>linux/pkg/terminal/buffer.go (6)</summary>

`25-31`: **LGTM! Well-designed incremental update tracking.**

The addition of change tracking fields to `BufferSnapshot` follows the vt10x pattern effectively. The `SequenceID` for deduplication and `ChangedLines` map for incremental updates will significantly reduce WebSocket traffic.

---

`104-170`: **Excellent vt10x-style deduplication implementation!**

The caching of unchanged snapshots and incremental updates with only changed lines will dramatically reduce update frequency. Note that consumers must handle nil entries in the `Cells` array when `IsIncremental` is true.

---

`741-754`: **Good addition of missing ANSI SGR sequences.**

The support for inverse video (7/27), individual attribute resets (21-24), and default color resets (39/49) improves ANSI compatibility.

---

`846-862`: **Smart optimization of the scroll operation.**

Reusing the top line buffer and using `copy()` for shifting reduces allocations. Correctly marks all lines as changed since content shifts.

---

`792-793`: **Correct implementation of clear operations with current colors.**

Using `currentFg` and `currentBg` when clearing cells matches standard terminal behavior where clear operations use the current background color.



Also applies to: 801-802, 808-809, 854-855

---

`49-49`: ```shell
#!/bin/bash
# Display the TerminalBuffer struct definition
rg -A10 -B0 ""type TerminalBuffer"" linux/pkg/terminal/buffer.go

# List all methods on TerminalBuffer
rg -n ""func (tb \\*TerminalBuffer)"" -n linux/pkg/terminal

# Search for any usage of 'viewportY' or related viewport logic

I've reviewed the changes in this PR which corrects the Docker image path for public ECR repositories.

### Changes Overview
- Updates the Docker image path structure from `public.ecr.aws/$ALIAS/mcp/$IMAGE` to `public.ecr.aws/$ALIAS/$OWNER/$IMAGE`
- Correctly leverages the `github.repository_owner` variable to define the repository path
- Adds the `OWNER` environment variable consistently to all relevant build steps

### Analysis
This change properly aligns with ECR's repository path structure, which requires the organization name as part of the path. The previous implementation had hardcoded ""mcp"" in the path, which doesn't match the expected pattern.

The implementation is correct and consistent across all relevant parts of the action file. This fix ensures that Docker images are pushed to the correct repository path in ECR.

### Tests
All CI checks pass with the exception of the Codecov/project check, which isn't directly related to this change as it's only modifying a GitHub workflow file, not actual code.

I approve this PR as it correctly fixes the ECR repository path issue without introducing any regressions.

I've reviewed the changes in this PR which addresses the following:

1. Corrects the Docker image path structure in the build-and-push-container-image action to use `${{ github.repository_owner }}` instead of hardcoding `mcp`.
   - This ensures proper ECR path naming convention and makes it more flexible for different repository owners.
   - The changes properly update 4 occurrences of the path, ensuring consistency throughout the workflow.

2. Updates the core-mcp-server version from 0.0.1 to 0.2.3, which aligns with the project's versioning standards.

3. Increases the codecov threshold from 0.1% to 1.0% to accommodate the occasional reporting discrepancies, which is a reasonable adjustment.

All CI checks are passing, and the changes are minimal with good focus. The PR follows the project's contributing guidelines and maintains compatibility with the existing codebase.

This PR enhances the flexibility and maintainability of the CI/CD pipeline and brings the core-mcp-server version in line with current standards.

I've reviewed the changes in PR #301, which addresses an issue with the ECR registry path in the GitHub Actions workflow.

### Changes Overview
- Fixed the ECR registry path to use `repository_owner` instead of hardcoded ""mcp"" in `.github/actions/build-and-push-container-image/action.yml`
- Updated core-mcp-server version from '0.0.1' to '0.2.3'
- Increased the codecov threshold from 0.1% to 1.0% to accommodate reporting discrepancies

### Assessment
The changes are straightforward and address the issue with the ECR registry path correctly. The repository owner should be dynamically determined rather than hardcoded to ensure proper image tagging and repository organization.

All CI checks are passing, and the PR doesn't introduce any breaking changes. The version update for core-mcp-server and codecov threshold adjustment are appropriate supporting changes.

This PR meets the contribution guidelines and is ready to be merged.

I've reviewed the changes in this pull request which changes the format of the generated SBOM from XML to JSON format. This is a good improvement as JSON is generally more widely used and easier to parse than XML.

### Changes overview
- Changed output format flag from `--output-format XML` to `--output-format JSON`
- Updated file extension from `sbom.xml` to `sbom.json` 
- Replaced XML parsing logic with JSON parsing logic
- Simplified the data extraction process by using direct dictionary access instead of XML element traversal

The changes look appropriate and should make the SBOM processing more straightforward. All tests are passing and there are no codecov concerns.

### Minor observations
- The error handling in the new JSON code is good with fallbacks to 'Unknown' values when keys aren't present
- The license extraction logic has been appropriately adapted to the JSON structure

I'm approving these changes as they represent a beneficial modernization of the SBOM format without introducing any functional regressions.

- Consider adding a brief explanation of the night mode feature and its parameters in the `BotConfig` docstring.
- The version check `config.INNER_VERSION in SpecifierSet("">=0.0.6"")` seems a bit fragile; consider a more robust method if `INNER_VERSION` is user-configurable.

## Summary
This PR introduces connection reuse for the Aurora DSQL MCP server, which is a significant performance enhancement that will make DSQL queries faster by eliminating the overhead of creating new connections for each query. The implementation is clean, well-documented, and introduces a flexible approach to both connection management and AWS credential handling.

## Strengths
- **Performance Enhancement**: Using a persistent connection approach significantly reduces overhead for multiple queries
- **Clean Implementation**: The connection reuse mechanism is cleanly implemented with proper error handling
- **Advanced Error Recovery**: Detects broken connections and automatically reconnects with good error isolation
- **Improved User Experience**: Better AWS profile handling with new  option
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Significantly enhanced README with clear examples and instructions
- **Thorough Testing**: New test files specifically for connection reuse and profile options

## Security Assessment
The implementation maintains the default read-only mode and properly handles AWS credentials through profiles rather than embedding them directly. The code appropriately handles database connections with proper error management.

## Final Assessment
This PR represents a high-quality improvement that enhances performance without breaking compatibility or introducing security concerns. The code is well-structured, well-tested, and properly documented.

I approve this PR for merging.

I've conducted a thorough review of this pull request which adds read-only mode to the DynamoDB MCP server and implements the list_imports API.

### Key changes:
1. Added a `mutation_check` decorator to block mutation operations when `DDB-MCP-READONLY` environment variable is set
2. Applied this decorator to all mutation operations in the DynamoDB server
3. Added a new `list_imports` API to view imports completed within the past 90 days
4. Added appropriate tests for the new functionality
5. Updated documentation to reflect the new read-only mode option

### Code quality:
- The implementation follows good practices with proper error handling and function documentation
- The decorator pattern is appropriately used to implement the read-only check across multiple functions
- Tests are comprehensive, including specific tests for the read-only functionality
- Environment variable parsing correctly handles multiple ""truthy"" values ('true', '1', 'yes')

### Security:
- This change enhances security by providing a way to restrict mutations, which is valuable for preventing accidental modifications
- The error message is clear and appropriately indicates why an operation is blocked

### Documentation:
- README.md has been updated to mention the new environment variable option

All CI checks are passing, and the changes align with the project's code style and design guidelines. The PR doesn't introduce breaking changes and enhances functionality in a backwards-compatible way.

I approve this PR which adds useful functionality for users who want to limit the DynamoDB MCP server to read-only operations.

This PR adds a fully configurable retry system to Roast workflows, enabling step-level and API-level retry policies with pluggable strategies, matchers, handlers, and metrics.

- Swapped in a `RetryableErrorHandler` and extended `StepOrchestrator` to build and apply retry policies
- Introduced core retry classes (`Retryable`, `RetryPolicy`, `RetryPolicyFactory`, strategies, matchers, handlers, metrics)
- Updated configuration loading, workflow base class, and documentation/tests to support retry definitions

I've completed a comprehensive review of PR #239 which adds Claude code review capabilities to the repository. 

### Summary of Changes
- Adds a GitHub workflow file (`claude.yml`) that triggers Claude Code to review PRs when they have the ""code-review"" label
- Adds a detailed guide (`CLAUDE_PR_REVIEW_GUIDE.md`) that instructs Claude on how to perform PR reviews

### Overall Assessment
The changes are well-structured and implement a valuable automated code review capability using Claude. The workflow is configured properly with appropriate permissions and environment setup. The guide document provides clear instructions for Claude to follow when reviewing PRs.

### Specific Observations
1. The workflow correctly configures necessary permissions and tokens for GitHub access
2. The Claude configuration is comprehensive with all required tools enabled
3. The review guide follows repository guidelines and focuses on important aspects of code quality
4. The workflow is properly conditioned to only run on PRs labeled with ""code-review""
5. The implementation is consistent with other workflows in the repository

### Improvement Suggestions
While the implementation is good as is, here are some minor suggestions:
- Consider adding brief comments in the workflow file to explain the purpose of the different sections
- For maintainability, consider extracting the list of allowed tools to a variable at the top of the workflow
- Fix the typo ""refernces"" to ""references"" in the review guide
- Fix the syntax error in the example Read tool code block (missing closing quote)

## Strengths
- **Comprehensive Implementation**: The server supports all major Valkey data types (Strings, Lists, Sets, Sorted Sets, Hashes, Streams, Bitmaps, HyperLogLog, and JSON) with appropriate operations for each.
- **Security Practices**: Good security handling with SSL/TLS support, proper authentication, and connection pooling.
- **Code Quality**: Well-structured code that follows the project's design guidelines and patterns.
- **Documentation**: Thorough documentation that integrates well with the project's existing docs.
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive tests for all data types and operations, including error scenarios.

## Minor Suggestions for Future Improvement
- Consider enhancing the logging implementation to use loguru consistently instead of printing to stderr in some error handling paths.
- Consider adding more architectural documentation or diagrams in future updates.
- Integration tests with actual Valkey instances could strengthen the test suite further.

Overall, this is a solid contribution that follows the project's patterns and will provide valuable functionality to users of MCP servers.

Hello @a-c-m, I'm Gemini Code Assist[^1]! I'm currently reviewing this pull request and will post my feedback shortly. In the meantime, here's a summary to help you and other reviewers quickly get up to speed!

This pull request significantly enhances the `ccusage` CLI tool by adding a dedicated command to monitor and report on Claude Code usage within its unique 5-hour billing windows. It provides users with critical information on current and projected token consumption and costs, helping them manage their usage more effectively and avoid unexpected overages. The changes involve new command implementation, core data processing logic, and updated documentation.

### Highlights

* **New Command: 5-Hour Blocks Report**: Introduced a new `blocks` command to analyze Claude Code usage, grouping it into 5-hour billing windows. This addresses the request in #23.
* **Usage Tracking and Projections**: The new command provides detailed insights into 5-hour blocks, including active block monitoring with time elapsed/remaining, burn rate calculations, and usage projections if the current burn rate continues.
* **Token Limit Management**: Users can now set token limits (`-t <number>`) or automatically use the highest previous block's token count (`-t max`) to track if they are approaching or exceeding their limits within a session.
* **Flexible Reporting Options**: The `blocks` command supports various filtering options like `--recent` (last 3 days) and `--active` (detailed view of current block), and offers both human-readable table and machine-readable JSON output formats.
* **Core Logic and Data Loading**: New core logic for identifying and calculating 5-hour blocks has been implemented in `src/utils/five-hour-blocks.ts`, and the data loading infrastructure in `src/data-loader.ts` has been extended to support this new reporting mechanism.

<summary>🧹 Nitpick comments (9)</summary><blockquote>

<details>
<summary>src/utils/five-hour-blocks.ts (2)</summary><blockquote>

`185-188`: **Avoid early rounding – it degrades projection accuracy**

`calculateBurnRate` rounds both `tokensPerMinute` and `costPerHour`, then `projectBlockUsage` multiplies these rounded numbers to estimate totals. On long remaining windows this can introduce noticeable drift.

Return full-precision numbers from `calculateBurnRate` and only round when formatting for display:

```diff
-  tokensPerMinute: Math.round(tokensPerMinute),
-  costPerHour: Math.round(costPerHour * 100) / 100,
+  tokensPerMinute,
+  costPerHour,
```

Then apply rounding in the CLI where the values are rendered.



Also applies to: 202-207

---

`176-180`: **Zero-minute blocks produce `null`; consider minimum window guard**

For blocks where the first and last entry share the same minute, `durationMinutes` becomes `0`, so burn-rate is `null`.  
If that’s unintended, clamp to at least one minute to avoid silent loss of data:

```ts
const durationMinutes = Math.max(1,
  (lastEntry.getTime() - firstEntry.getTime()) / 60000);
```

</blockquote></details>
<details>
<summary>src/data-loader.ts (2)</summary><blockquote>

`843-849`: **Stream JSONL files instead of loading them wholesale**

`readFile(..., 'utf-8')` followed by `.split('\n')` loads the entire file into memory.  
Large project histories can easily reach hundreds of MB, causing high RAM spikes.

Consider using an async line iterator (`createInterface` from `readline/promises` or Bun/Deno equivalents) so lines are processed incrementally:

```ts
const rl = createInterface({ input: createReadStream(file) });
for await (const line of rl) { /* parse */ }
```

---

`869-872`: **Cost calculation throttles I/O**

`await calculateCostForEntry` is executed inside the tight inner loop, forcing strictly sequential processing. If `PricingFetcher` involves I/O (e.g. remote price fetch), total load time grows linearly with message count.

Batch-fetch prices for distinct models once, or make `calculateCostForEntry` synchronous by pre-seeding a local pricing table.

</blockquote></details>
<details>
<summary>src/commands/blocks.ts (2)</summary><blockquote>

`230-260`: **Factor out token-limit parsing to keep CLI logic DRY**

`parseInt`/`max` handling is repeated in two separate branches. A tiny helper improves readability and prevents divergent behaviour on future edits.

```ts
function resolveTokenLimit(raw: string | undefined, maxFromHistory: number): number | undefined {
  if (!raw) return undefined;
  if (raw === 'max') return maxFromHistory || undefined;
  const n = Number.parseInt(raw, 10);
  return Number.isFinite(n) ? n : undefined;
}
```

Then call `const limit = resolveTokenLimit(ctx.values.tokenLimit, maxTokensFromAll);`



Also applies to: 269-279

---

`282-299`: **Header alignment relies on parallel arrays – fragile for future edits**

`tableHeaders` and `tableAligns` must stay in sync manually. A small slip adds a hard-to-notice column mismatch.

Wrap these in a single array of objects `{ title, align }` to keep structure cohesive and avoid off-by-one errors.

</blockquote></details>
<details>
<summary>README.md (3)</summary><blockquote>

`219-223`: **Align section title and description with established report naming.**
The heading should follow the singular ""Report"" convention (e.g., ""5-Hour Block Report"") and drop the unnecessary possessive ""Claude's"" in the description for consistency with other sections.

---

`224-233`: **Avoid contractions in code example comments.**
Replace ""you'll"" with ""you will"" in the ""# Set a token limit to see if you'll exceed it"" line to maintain a professional, consistent tone across examples.

---

`255-260`: **Use consistent terminology for report items.**
The bullet list mixes ""sessions"" and ""blocks"" (e.g., ""highest previous session"")—it should consistently refer to ""blocks"" to avoid confusion with the Session report.

`219-253`: **Add a “5-Hour Blocks Report” bullet to the global *Features* list.**

A new high-level capability is being introduced, but the “Features” section (lines 40-52) still omits it.  A quick bullet such as  
`- ⏱ **5-Hour Blocks Report**: View usage grouped by 5-hour billing windows`  
keeps the feature matrix in sync with the rest of the docs.

---

`262-266`: **Remove trailing colon in heading to satisfy MD026.**

`#### Blocks-specific options:` → `#### Blocks-specific options`  
This silences the markdown-lint warning flagged by CI and avoids inconsistent heading style.

</blockquote></details>
<details>
<summary>src/commands/blocks.ts (2)</summary><blockquote>

`130-141`: **`--active` silently chooses the first active block when >1 exist.**

`blocks.filter(block => block.isActive)` can legally return several items if the grouping logic ever mis-detects overlaps (clock skew, corrupted data, tests). When that happens, the detailed view later only shows `blocks[0]`, dropping the rest without warning.  

Consider:

```diff
-if (ctx.values.active && blocks.length === 1) {
+if (ctx.values.active && blocks.length === 1) {
     …
-} else {
+} else if (ctx.values.active) {
+    logger.warn(`${blocks.length} active blocks detected; showing table view.`);
 }
```

Alternatively, fail fast with an explicit error.

---

`228-246`: **Warn on un-parsable `-t/--token-limit` values.**

If the user passes an invalid string (e.g. `-t foo`), `parseTokenLimit` returns `undefined`, but execution continues as if the flag were never supplied. Surfacing a warning avoids silent mis-configuration:

```diff
 const limit = parseTokenLimit(ctx.values.tokenLimit, maxTokensFromAll);
 if (limit) {
     …
 } else if (ctx.values.tokenLimit) {
-    /* silent */
+    logger.warn(`Ignoring invalid --token-limit value: ""${ctx.values.tokenLimit}"". Expected number or ""max"".`);
 }
```

`255-307`: **Percentage calculations assume a valid `actualTokenLimit`**  

All `%` displays (`percentage`, `remainingPercent`, etc.) should skip or visibly mark the field when `actualTokenLimit` is `undefined`. Current guards prevent most cases, but edge-paths still exist (e.g., user passes `-t foo`). Consider early-returning with a warning when `parseTokenLimit` fails, to avoid partial/incorrect tables.

---

`167-178`: **Unchecked division by `limit` when it is `undefined` or `0`**

Even with the guard above, `limit` is re-evaluated inline and could still be `undefined` if parsing fails, causing `projection.totalTokens / limit` to evaluate to `Infinity` or `NaN`.  Safeguard before performing maths:

```diff
-const limit = parseTokenLimit(ctx.values.tokenLimit, maxTokensFromAll);
-return limit
-  ? {
-      ...
-      percentUsed: (projection.totalTokens / limit) * 100,
-      ...

-  : undefined;

`57-66`: **`parseTokenLimit` still accepts 0 / negative numbers — divide-by-zero risk**

A prior review already flagged this, but the implementation was not updated.  
`0` (or `<0`) propagates to `%` calculations and JSON projection (`projection.totalTokens / limit`) causing `Infinity`, NaN, or runtime `ZeroDivisionError` equivalents.

```diff
- const limit = Number.parseInt(value, 10);

`897-911`: **Reuse `filterByDateRange()` instead of open-coded string compare**

The bespoke date check duplicates the earlier `filterByDateRange` helper but is slightly different (empty-string handling, `replace(/-/g,'')` etc.). Divergent logic risks subtle regressions.

```diff

`172-186`: **Guard `%` calculations against `undefined` / missing limit**

Even after fixing `parseTokenLimit`, `percentUsed` is evaluated without ensuring `limit` is defined (it might be `undefined` if user omits `-t`). Wrap the division:

```diff
- percentUsed: (projection.totalTokens / limit) * 100,
+ percentUsed: limit != null ? (projection.totalTokens / limit) * 100 : undefined,
```

Prevents accidental `NaN` in JSON output.

This PR adds a new `blocks` command to report Claude Code usage in five-hour billing windows.

- Implements logic to segment usage into 5-hour blocks (with gap detection), and compute burn rates and projections.
- Integrates a new `loadFiveHourBlockData` loader and registers `blocksCommand` in the CLI.
- Updates the README with examples and flags for the `blocks` command.

**src/commands/blocks.ts:179**
* [nitpick] In the JSON output, `percentUsed` is an unrounded float. It may be clearer to round this to a fixed precision (e.g., one decimal place) so downstream consumers get a consistent format.
```
												percentUsed: (projection.totalTokens / limit) * 100,
```
**src/utils/five-hour-blocks.ts:47**
* Core logic in `identifyFiveHourBlocks` (including gap-block creation and edge cases) isn't covered by existing tests. Adding unit tests for typical and gap scenarios would help guard against regressions.
```
export function identifyFiveHourBlocks(entries: LoadedUsageEntry[]): FiveHourBlock[] {
```
**src/commands/blocks.ts:163**
* [nitpick] The `entries` field in the JSON output holds a count, not the actual entries. Consider renaming it to `entryCount` or `entriesCount` to avoid confusion.
```
						entries: block.entries.length,
```

<summary>src/data-loader.ts (1)</summary><blockquote>

`852-899`: **Third copy-paste of the JSONL parsing pipeline – please extract a shared helper**  

The block between lines 852-899 is functionally identical to the loops inside `loadDailyUsageData()` and `loadSessionData()`.  
Past reviews already flagged this duplication (see earlier comment #823-895).  Centralising the logic would:

* remove ~200 LOC of repetition  
* ensure schema / dedup / cost fixes land in one place  
* simplify testing.

Consider a helper like `parseClaudeJsonlFiles(files, processedHashes, mode, fetcher): Promise<LoadedUsageEntry[]>`.

<summary>src/commands/blocks.ts (1)</summary><blockquote>

`58-67`: **`parseTokenLimit()` accepts 0/negative limits – causes divide-by-zero & bogus % calculations**

Returning `0` (or a negative number) is treated later as a *valid* limit, producing `Infinity`/negative percentages.

```diff
-const limit = Number.parseInt(value, 10);
-return Number.isNaN(limit) ? undefined : limit;
+const limit = Number.parseInt(value, 10);
+if (Number.isNaN(limit) || limit <= 0) {
+  return undefined;              // or throw if you prefer
+}
+return limit;
```

Side note: this parsing logic now exists in multiple commands; extracting it to `utils.internal.ts` would improve maintainability.

`70-72`: **Remove unreachable null-check on `lastEntry`.**

`currentBlockEntries` always contains at least one element once we’re inside the `else` branch (we push the first entry when the block is opened).  
The guard adds noise and can be safely deleted.

```diff
-			const lastEntry = currentBlockEntries.at(-1);
-			if (lastEntry == null) {
-				continue;
-			}
+			const lastEntry = currentBlockEntries.at(-1); // never null
```

`113-114`: **`isActive` may become stale shortly after computation.**

`now` is captured once at the start of `identifyFiveHourBlocks` and passed to every block.  
If the caller re-uses the resulting blocks for longer-running CLI output or caching, a block that *was* active may appear *inactive* minutes later (and vice-versa).

Consider computing `isActive` lazily (getter) or recalculating with the real-time clock when the value is consumed.

---

`160-162`: **Gap block `endTime` stretches beyond 5 h window.**

While the comment on `endTime` now acknowledges that gap blocks use `nextActivityTime`, consumers still need to branch on `isGap` to reason about block length.  
A cleaner design is a discriminated union:

```ts
type NormalBlock = { isGap?: false; endTime: Date /* start + 5h */; ... }
type GapBlock    = { isGap: true;  gapEndTime: Date; endTime?: never; ... }
```

This enforces invariants at compile-time and removes implicit contracts from JSDoc.

`75-84`: **Zero / negative token limits still accepted – re-introduces divide-by-zero bug**

`parseTokenLimit` no longer guards against `<= 0`, so `""0""` or `""-10""` silently propagate and later cause `Infinity` percentages.  

```diff
-const limit = Number.parseInt(value, 10);
-return Number.isNaN(limit) ? undefined : limit;
+const limit = Number.parseInt(value, 10);

`5-5`: **Consider extracting a reusable `TableCell` type alias**

`TableRow` now embeds an inline object type for rich cells.  Declaring a dedicated alias – e.g.  
`type TableCell = string | number | { content: string; hAlign?: 'left'|'right'|'center' };` – would keep the row type readable and avoid repeating the union elsewhere.

---

`38-43`: **DRY up cell-to-string conversion**

The anonymous callback is re-implementing the same “unwrap object cell → string” logic that also appears in `isSeparatorRow`.  A tiny helper such as  

```ts
function cellText(cell: TableCell): string {
  return typeof cell === 'object' && cell !== null && 'content' in cell
    ? cell.content
    : String(cell ?? '');
}
```

would remove duplication and make future tweaks (e.g. stripping ANSI codes) trivial.

---

`154-159`: **`isSeparatorRow` can short-circuit & reuse a helper**

Minor: once you have a `cellText()` helper (see comment above) this predicate collapses to

```ts
return row.every(c => {
  const txt = cellText(c);
  return txt === '' || /^─+$/.test(txt);
});
```

reducing nesting and object checks.

`190-204`: **`parseTokenLimit` is called inside every `.map` – compute once**

The JSON branch invokes `parseTokenLimit` for every block even though the value is identical for the whole command run.  Parsing it once upfront (after `maxTokensFromAll` is known) both improves clarity and avoids unnecessary work.

```diff
-const jsonOutput = {
+const limit = parseTokenLimit(ctx.values.tokenLimit, maxTokensFromAll);
+const jsonOutput = {
   blocks: blocks.map(block => {
     …
-    tokenLimitStatus: projection != null && ctx.values.tokenLimit != null
+    tokenLimitStatus: projection != null && limit != null
         ? {
-            limit,
+            limit,
             projectedUsage: projection.totalTokens,
             percentUsed: (projection.totalTokens / limit) * 100,
             status: projection.totalTokens > limit
               ? 'exceeds'
               : projection.totalTokens > limit * 0.8 ? 'warning' : 'ok',
           }
         : undefined,
   }),
};
```

This pull request fixes an issue where the search box clear button was leaving a ""MESSAGES"" badge visible by resetting the search type. Key changes include:
- Resetting the search type to an empty string in the clearSearch function.
- Adding a data-testid attribute to the SearchTypeBadge for improved testability.
- Introducing an end-to-end test to verify that no search type badge appears after clearing the search box.

The boolean parsing logic accepts ""true"", ""1"", or ""yes"" as true values, which provides flexibility. However, consider validating that the parameter value is one of the expected formats to provide better error messages for invalid inputs.


```diff
// Extract includeStackTrace parameter
let includeStackTrace = true; // Default to true for backward compatibility
if (variables[""includeStackTrace""] !== undefined) {
  const value = variables[""includeStackTrace""] as string;
+  if (!['true', '1', 'yes', 'false', '0', 'no'].includes(value.toLowerCase())) {
+    throw new McpUnityError(ErrorType.VALIDATION, `Invalid includeStackTrace parameter: must be true/false, 1/0, or yes/no`);
+  }
  includeStackTrace = value === 'true' || value === '1' || value === 'yes';
}
```

`24-27`: **Clear documentation with actionable guidance.**

The parameter documentation is excellent with a prominent warning about token savings. This will help developers make informed decisions about stack trace inclusion.

---

`62-62`: <details>
<summary>✅ Verification successful</summary>

**Verify documentation consistency about info logs default behavior.**

The parameter extraction and usage look correct. However, the description mentions ""Default: true (except info logs in resource)"" but I don't see special handling for info logs in this tool implementation.





Also applies to: 71-71

---

🏁 Script executed:

```shell
#!/bin/bash
# Search for any special handling of info logs with different includeStackTrace defaults
rg -A 10 -B 5 ""info.*includeStackTrace|includeStackTrace.*info"" --type js --type ts
```

Length of output: 1357

</details>

**Default behavior for info logs is handled in the resource, not the tool**  
The tool’s parameter extraction here correctly defaults `includeStackTrace` to `true`. In `src/resources/getConsoleLogsResource.ts`, the info‐logs URI already specifies `includeStackTrace=false`, so no additional handling is needed in the tool.

</details>
<details>
<summary>Editor/Services/IConsoleLogsService.cs (1)</summary>

`19-21`: **Interface updated correctly with proper documentation.**

The parameter addition to the interface is well-documented and maintains backward compatibility with the default value of `true`.

</details>
<details>
<summary>Editor/Services/ConsoleLogsService.cs (2)</summary>

`88-88`: **Method signature updated correctly.**

The parameter addition maintains backward compatibility and follows C# conventions with proper default value.

---

`131-144`: **Conditional stack trace inclusion implemented correctly.**

The logic properly creates the base log object and conditionally adds the stack trace field only when requested. This approach is clean and efficient.

</details>
<details>
<summary>Server~/src/tools/getConsoleLogsTool.ts (2)</summary>

`31-34`: **TypeScript implementation consistent with JavaScript version.**

The parameter definition and warning message are identical to the JavaScript version, which ensures consistency across the codebase.

---

`83-83`: **Parameter handling consistent and type-safe.**

The parameter extraction and usage follow the same pattern as the JavaScript version while maintaining TypeScript type safety.



Also applies to: 93-93

</details>
<details>
<summary>Editor/Resources/GetConsoleLogsResource.cs (5)</summary>

`17-17`: **Excellent documentation with clear guidance for LLM token optimization.**

The description effectively communicates the purpose and benefits of the new parameter while providing practical usage recommendations.

---

`35-35`: **Parameter extraction follows established pattern.**

The implementation correctly uses the new helper method with appropriate default value for backward compatibility.

---

`40-40`: **Service method call properly updated.**

The parameter is correctly passed to the service method, maintaining the existing call pattern.

---

`48-48`: **Response message appropriately includes the parameter value.**

Adding the `includeStackTrace` value to the pagination summary provides useful feedback to clients about the actual parameter used.

---

`73-85`: **Well-implemented helper method following established patterns.**

The `GetBoolParameter` method correctly follows the same pattern as the existing `GetIntParameter` method with proper null checking and safe type conversion.

</details>
<details>
<summary>Server~/src/resources/getConsoleLogsResource.ts (4)</summary>

`11-11`: **Resource URI template correctly updated.**

The template properly includes the new `includeStackTrace` parameter alongside existing pagination parameters.

---

`20-41`: **Excellent predefined resource configurations with LLM-optimized defaults.**

The predefined URIs provide sensible defaults for different log types:
- Info logs default to `includeStackTrace=false` (optimal for info logs)
- Other log types default to `true` for backward compatibility
- Clear warnings and guidance in descriptions help users make informed choices

---

`104-106`: **Parameter correctly added to Unity request.**

The `includeStackTrace` parameter is properly included in the request parameters sent to Unity.

---

`118-118`: **Response URI correctly reflects actual parameters used.**

Including the `includeStackTrace` parameter in the response URI provides useful feedback about the request that was processed.

</details>
<details>
<summary>Server~/build/resources/getConsoleLogsResource.js (6)</summary>

`6-6`: **Resource URI template consistent with TypeScript version.**

The template correctly matches the TypeScript implementation.

---

`14-35`: **Predefined resource configurations match TypeScript implementation.**

The URIs and descriptions are consistent with the TypeScript source, providing the same LLM-optimized defaults and clear guidance.

---

`69-74`: **Boolean parsing logic consistent with TypeScript version.**

The parameter extraction and parsing logic correctly matches the TypeScript implementation.

---

`88-89`: **Parameter correctly included in Unity request.**

The `includeStackTrace` parameter is properly added to the request parameters.

---

`97-97`: **Response URI correctly includes all parameters.**

The response URI properly reflects the actual parameters used in the request.

---

`76-81`: <details>
<summary>✅ Verification successful</summary>

**Verify pagination validation exists in TypeScript source.**

The JavaScript file includes validation for `offset` and `limit` parameters, but this validation doesn't appear to be present in the TypeScript source file. Ensure the TypeScript source includes the same validation logic.

---

🏁 Script executed:

```shell
#!/bin/bash
# Description: Check if pagination validation exists in the TypeScript source file
# Expected: Find validation logic for offset and limit parameters

rg -A 10 -B 2 ""isNaN.*offset|isNaN.*limit"" Server~/src/resources/getConsoleLogsResource.ts
```

While the comment is technically correct about the whitespace, this is an extremely minor issue that would typically be handled automatically by code formatters or linters. It doesn't affect functionality, readability, or code quality in any meaningful way. Our rules emphasize focusing on substantial issues and avoiding obvious or unimportant comments.
The whitespace could be a sign of inconsistent code formatting practices which might compound over time. Some teams do care about strict formatting.
While formatting consistency is important, this is too minor to warrant a PR comment. This should be handled by automated tools rather than manual review comments.

I've reviewed this pull request which modifies the `.github/codecov.yml` file to change the code coverage threshold from `0` to `0.1` to handle occasional codecov reporting discrepancies that can cause build failures.

### Change Analysis
- The PR modifies a single file: `.github/codecov.yml`
- It changes the threshold parameter from 0 to 0.1 to accommodate small discrepancies in codecov reporting
- The change is properly commented in the file to explain the reason for the change
- This is a minimal change with no impact on actual code quality or behavior

### Assessment
This change makes sense as it addresses an infrastructure/CI issue. Having a small threshold of 0.1% will prevent false build failures when there's a minor discrepancy in codecov reporting, while still maintaining high standards for code coverage.

The PR has already been approved by two reviewers (krokoko and theagenticguy) and all checks except the PR title validation have passed. The change is well-documented and purpose-oriented.

I approve this PR as it represents a reasonable solution to the described problem without compromising code quality standards.

Hello @ming86, I'm Gemini Code Assist[^1]! I'm currently reviewing this pull request and will post my feedback shortly. In the meantime, here's a summary to help you and other reviewers quickly get up to speed!

This pull request fixes a regression caused by PR #60, which was merged while still a work-in-progress. The bug involved passing parameters in the wrong order to the model restriction service for Google's Gemini models, leading to incorrect restriction checks and errors. This PR corrects the parameter order and adds comments for clarity.

### Highlights

* **Regression Fix**: Addresses a bug introduced in PR #60 where the parameters for the `restriction_service.is_allowed()` method were incorrectly ordered when checking Google (Gemini) models.
* **Parameter Correction**: Swaps the `model_name` and `resolved_name` arguments in the `is_allowed()` calls within the Gemini provider to match the expected `(provider_type, canonical_model_name, original_user_input)` signature.
* **Code Clarity**: Adds comments to the relevant lines in `providers/gemini.py` to explicitly state the expected parameter order for the restriction service method, helping prevent future confusion.

This pull request effectively addresses the parameter order regression for `restriction_service.is_allowed()` calls in the Gemini provider. The changes correctly swap the `model_name` and `resolved_name` arguments to align with the method's definition, ensuring that the canonical model name and the original user input are passed in the correct order.

I've reviewed the changes that add terraform module analysis capabilities to the cost-analysis-mcp-server. The implementation looks solid, well-tested, and significantly improves the ability of the cost analyzer to detect AWS resources used in Terraform modules.

### Strengths:

- The implementation follows the established code patterns in the repository
- Comprehensive support for different module formats:
  - terraform-aws-modules
  - aws-ia modules
  - Third-party modules with AWS provider
  - Local modules (with recursive analysis)
- Thorough test coverage with multiple module types and scenarios
- Well-documented code with clear logging
- Clean error handling

### Code Quality:

- The implementation properly extracts service names from module sources using regex patterns
- The module analysis is thorough and handles various edge cases
- Good security practices are followed for local module analysis

### Testing:

- Tests cover all the major use cases and module types
- Local module analysis is tested properly with temporary directories
- Both positive and negative test cases are included

### Small Concerns:

- Codecov report indicates the PR has 82.72% patch coverage with 19 lines missing coverage
- These appear to be primarily in error handling branches, which is generally acceptable

Given the thoroughness of the implementation and testing, I'm approving this PR. The feature significantly enhances the cost analyzer's ability to provide accurate analyses of Terraform projects using modules, which is a common pattern in real-world deployments.

I've reviewed the terraform module analyzer implementation for the cost-analysis-mcp-server component. This is a valuable addition that enhances the server's ability to detect and analyze AWS resources within Terraform modules.

### Strengths

- Comprehensive support for various module formats:
  - terraform-aws-modules format (e.g., `terraform-aws-modules/s3-bucket/aws`)
  - aws-ia modules (e.g., `aws-ia/lambda-function/aws`)
  - Third-party modules with AWS provider (e.g., `cloudposse/ecs-container-definition/aws`) 
  - Local modules with recursive analysis

- Well-structured code that follows the repository's patterns and design guidelines
- Thorough error handling with appropriate logging
- Good usage of regular expressions to extract service names from module sources
- Clean separation of concerns with dedicated methods for different analysis tasks

### Code Quality

- The implementation is robust with logical extraction of service names from module sources
- Good test coverage with multiple realistic test cases (~83% coverage)
- Proper documentation with descriptive docstrings
- Progressive logging for traceability

### Minor Suggestions

While not requiring immediate action, consider for future improvements:

1. The error handling paths in `_find_aws_services_from_module()` and `_analyze_file()` appear to be the main areas with missing test coverage. Adding test cases for these paths would improve coverage.

2. Consider adding additional markers for more complex module naming patterns that don't follow the standard formats, as real-world Terraform modules may have varied naming conventions.

I've reviewed the implementation of the Terraform Module Analyzer for the cost-analysis-mcp-server, which adds support for identifying AWS resources from Terraform modules. This enhancement significantly improves the server's ability to analyze infrastructure costs by detecting resources defined through modules, not just direct resource declarations.

### Key strengths:

1. **Comprehensive module support**: The implementation handles various module types including terraform-aws-modules, aws-ia modules, and local modules.

2. **Recursive analysis**: For local modules, the analyzer recursively processes the module directory to identify AWS services, which is essential for complete cost analysis.

3. **Robust testing**: The PR includes extensive tests that validate the functionality for different module types and edge cases.

4. **Clean code structure**: The implementation follows good software engineering practices with clear method boundaries and proper error handling.

5. **Good logging**: The code includes appropriate logging statements that will help with debugging and understanding the analyzer's behavior.

### Suggestions for future improvements:

1. The current implementation makes assumptions about service names based on module naming patterns (using the first part of the module name). While this is a reasonable heuristic, a more comprehensive approach might involve maintaining a mapping of popular modules to their AWS services.

2. Consider adding support for more complex variable handling, especially for modules that use nested variable structures or complex expressions.

3. The test coverage is good at 82.7%, but there are still some execution paths that aren't covered. Consider adding more edge case tests to improve coverage further.

Overall, this is a valuable addition that significantly enhances the cost analysis capabilities of the server by providing more complete resource detection.

I've conducted a comprehensive review of this PR that introduces a new AWS Serverless MCP Server. While this is an impressive contribution with substantial functionality (18,430+ lines added), there are several important design guideline violations and code quality issues that need to be addressed before approval.

## Summary of Review

**Positive Aspects:**
- Comprehensive functionality covering SAM, Lambda, and serverless deployments
- Excellent test coverage (87.70%) with thorough unit tests
- Proper Pydantic models and FastMCP integration
- Good project structure with organized tools and resources
- All CI checks pass including builds and security scans
- Proper licensing and copyright headers
- Follows repository naming conventions

**Issues Requiring Changes:**

### 1. **Critical**: Missing Constants Management (Design Guideline Violation)
The Design Guidelines require a dedicated consts.py file for constants organization. Currently, constants like DEFAULT_LOG_DIR are scattered across files.

**Required Action:** Create src/aws-serverless-mcp-server/awslabs/aws_serverless_mcp_server/consts.py and consolidate all constants.

### 2. **Critical**: Incorrect Logging Implementation (Design Guideline Violation)
The Design Guidelines mandate using loguru for logging, but this implementation uses Python's standard logging module in utils/logger.py.

**Required Action:** Replace standard logging with loguru implementation as specified in the guidelines.

### 3. **Important**: Oversized server.py File
The server.py file is 1,311 lines, which makes it difficult to maintain. Many tool implementations should be extracted to separate modules.

**Recommendation:** Extract large tool functions to individual files in the /tools/ subdirectories.

### 4. **Important**: Missing FastMCP Instructions
The server lacks the comprehensive instructions block that should guide AI models on how to use the server effectively.

**Required Action:** Add detailed instructions to the FastMCP initialization as shown in other servers.

### 5. **Minor**: Package Name Inconsistency
The README references awslabs.aws-serverless-mcp but the actual package is awslabs.aws-serverless-mcp-server.

## Assessment Against Repository Standards

Based on the Contributing Guidelines and Design Guidelines:

1. **License & Copyright**: ✅ Proper Apache 2.0 headers
2. **Code Organization**: ⚠️ Good structure but server.py too large  
3. **Constants Management**: ❌ Missing dedicated consts.py
4. **Logging**: ❌ Wrong logging framework used
5. **Testing**: ✅ Excellent coverage (87.70%)
6. **Documentation**: ✅ Comprehensive README
7. **Type Safety**: ✅ Proper Pydantic models
8. **MCP Patterns**: ✅ Correct FastMCP usage

## Required Changes Summary

1. **Create consts.py** - Move all constants to dedicated file
2. **Implement loguru logging** - Replace standard logging with loguru  
3. **Add FastMCP instructions** - Provide comprehensive server guidance
4. **Fix package name consistency** - Align README with actual package name

## Approval Status

While this is a valuable contribution with excellent functionality and test coverage, the design guideline violations (particularly constants management and logging implementation) must be addressed to maintain consistency with the established patterns in this repository.

**Decision: REQUEST_CHANGES**

The core functionality is solid and the contribution is much appreciated. Once the design guideline issues are resolved, this will be an excellent addition to the AWS MCP server collection.

I've conducted a comprehensive review of this PR that introduces a new AWS Serverless MCP Server. This is an impressive contribution with substantial functionality (18,317+ lines added), and most of the implementation follows the repository's design guidelines well. However, there are a few important issues that need to be addressed before approval.

## Summary of Review

**Positive Aspects:**
✅ **All CI checks passing** - Excellent security and quality validation
✅ **Proper loguru logging** - Correctly uses `from loguru import logger` throughout
✅ **Constants file present** - Has `utils/const.py` for configuration
✅ **Excellent test coverage** - 87.88% coverage with comprehensive unit tests  
✅ **Proper license headers** - Consistent Apache 2.0 headers across all files
✅ **Good FastMCP integration** - Proper use of FastMCP class with instructions
✅ **Comprehensive functionality** - Covers SAM, Lambda, and serverless deployments
✅ **Well-organized project structure** - Follows established patterns with tools, resources, utils

## Issues Requiring Changes

### 1. **Package Name Inconsistency** (Minor but Important)
**Issue**: The README contains inconsistent package references:
- In JSON config: `""awslabs.aws_serverless_mcp_server@latest""` (with underscores)
- Package name should be: `""awslabs.aws-serverless-mcp-server@latest""` (with hyphens)

**Location**: README.md configuration examples
**Fix**: Update all README examples to use the correct hyphenated package name that matches `pyproject.toml`

### 2. **Minimal Constants Implementation** (Minor Enhancement)
**Issue**: The `utils/const.py` file only contains 2 constants while many hardcoded values exist throughout the codebase that could be centralized.

**Recommendation**: Consider consolidating other repeated values like default timeouts, API endpoints, error messages, etc.

### 3. **Large Server File** (Organization Improvement)
**Issue**: The `server.py` file is 1,305 lines, making it harder to maintain. While functional, this could be better organized.

**Recommendation**: Consider extracting some of the larger tool implementations to dedicated files in the `/tools/` subdirectories for better maintainability.

## Final Assessment

This is a high-quality contribution that demonstrates excellent engineering practices and comprehensive functionality. The core implementation is solid and follows most repository standards correctly. The issues identified are relatively minor and should be straightforward to address.

**Decision: REQUEST_CHANGES**

The primary issue requiring changes is the package name inconsistency in the README, which could confuse users trying to install the server. Once this is corrected, along with consideration of the minor enhancements, this will be an excellent addition to the AWS MCP server collection.

**Required Fix**: Update all README examples to consistently use the hyphenated package name `awslabs.aws-serverless-mcp-server` that matches pyproject.toml.

## Design Guidelines Compliance Assessment

After thorough review against the repository's Design Guidelines:

**✅ FULLY COMPLIANT:**
- ✅ Constants management: Has `utils/const.py` file with AWS_REGION and DEPLOYMENT_STATUS_DIR
- ✅ Logging framework: Uses `from loguru import logger` consistently throughout
- ✅ Project structure: Follows established patterns with proper module organization
- ✅ Type definitions: Excellent Pydantic models with comprehensive validation
- ✅ License headers: Consistent Apache 2.0 headers across all files
- ✅ Entry points: Correct server.py structure with main() function
- ✅ FastMCP instructions: Comprehensive guidance for AI models
- ✅ Async patterns: Proper async/await implementation throughout

## Final Assessment

This is a high-quality contribution that demonstrates excellent engineering practices and provides substantial value to the serverless development community. The core implementation is solid and follows repository standards well.

**Decision: REQUEST_CHANGES**

**Primary Blocker**: Package name inconsistency in README that could cause installation issues for users.

## Required Action

1. **REQUIRED**: Fix package name consistency in README examples (high priority - should be straightforward)

Once the README package naming is corrected, this will be an excellent addition to the AWS MCP server collection. Thank you for this substantial and well-executed contribution\!
